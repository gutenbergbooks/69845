<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br>

ON HIS MAJESTY’S SERVICE</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I had</span> only just let myself into the hall of the
quiet house in the respectable street beside the British
Museum when my ear was startled by the subdued
shrilling of the telephone bell overhead. Whether
this was the first time it had sounded, or whether that
alarming call was being repeated for the second or
third time, I had no means of knowing, as I turned
hurriedly to fasten the front door behind me. Cautiously,
and yet as swiftly as I dared, I shot the bolts
and began speeding on tiptoe up the two flights of
stairs between me and safety from detection. The
night telephone was placed beside my bed on the
second floor, but Sir Frank Tarleton slept on the
same landing; and unless I could reach my room and
still that persistent ringing before it penetrated
through his slumber I ran the risk of meeting him
coming out to find why it was not answered. And
not for much, not for very much, would I have had
the great consultant see me returning to his house at
an hour when daylight was already flooding the
deserted streets of the still sleeping city.</p>

<p>There was something ominous in the continuous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
peal that sounded louder and louder in my ears
with every step I made towards it. It seemed as
though the unknown caller must know of my predicament
and be bent on exposing me. I clutched the
rail of the banisters to steady myself as I panted
up those interminable stairs in the darkness, and my
feet felt clogged like those of one in a nightmare
as I lifted them from step to step; all the while racking
my brains for some excuse to offer for the breach
of duty I had been guilty of in spending the night
elsewhere. For my real excuse, the only one that
could have tempted me to betray my chief’s confidence,
could never be disclosed.</p>

<p>The darkness all around me seemed to be vibrating
with the merciless clamour overhead as I toiled
through those tense moments. My knees trembled
under me, and my heart well-nigh stopped beating,
as my head reached the level of the last landing and
I turned my eyes desperately to the physician’s door
in search of any sign that he had been aroused.</p>

<p>No sign as yet, thank Heaven! Five more stairs,
three lightning strides to my own door, and he would
never know of the secret errand that had taken me
away from my post that night.</p>

<p>At last my agony was ended. I stood breathless
on the topmost stair, darted past Sir Frank’s room,
not daring to pause and listen for any movement
from within, and clutched the handle of my own
door, summoning all my nerve to open and close it
again so rapidly as to permit the least possible sound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
to escape. An instant later and I had reached the
telephone and silenced its urgent voice, and was
beginning to draw my breath freely for the first time
since I had reached the house.</p>

<p>Then, after a few deep gasps, I hailed the caller.</p>

<p>“Inspector Charles of Scotland Yard speaking,”
came grimly over the wire. “Who is there?”</p>

<p>There was nothing to startle me in the fact that
the police were calling so imperatively. Tarleton
was the greatest living authority on poisons; it was
to pursue his researches in their mysterious history
that he lived in the unfashionable neighbourhood of
the Museum; and the Home Office treated him with
a confidence which they placed in no other of their
advisers. Neither was there any cause for uneasiness
in the Inspector’s cautious question. Very many
of the calls that came to that unpretending house in
that quiet corner of London had a certain character
of furtiveness, and the callers showed the same anxiety
to make sure whom they were speaking with.</p>

<p>My usual response came to my lips mechanically.
“This is Dr. Cassilis, Sir Frank Tarleton’s
confidential assistant. The doctor is asleep.”</p>

<p>There was a pause before the caller spoke again.
There was nothing alarming to me in that, either.
I had grown accustomed to the pause during my first
few weeks under the roof of the great consultant.
Few of those who needed his services liked to disclose
their business to a deputy.</p>

<p>“Please have him waked immediately. He is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
wanted as soon as possible—on His Majesty’s
service.”</p>

<p>The request was peremptory, nevertheless I was
not inclined to give way to it at once. The police
formula made no difference to me. I was His
Majesty’s servant as much as my chief, and it was
for me, and not for the Inspector, to decide which
of us was to take the case. At the same time I
began casting off my clothes so as to be ready to go
in and rouse Tarleton if it became necessary; and
one hand was busy with my necktie and collar while
the other held the telephone mouthpiece to my lips.</p>

<p>“My instructions are not to disturb Sir Frank
unless I am satisfied that the case is urgent, and that
I can’t deal with it myself,” I said firmly. “I must
ask you to tell me something more.”</p>

<p>There was another pause before the caller spoke
again, and I took advantage of it to wrench off my
collar and throw my waistcoat after my coat onto
the floor. When the wire buzzed again the first
words that reached my ear nearly caused me to drop
the tube from my fingers.</p>

<p>“I am speaking from the Domino Club, Vincent
Studios, Tarifa Road, Chelsea. There was a masked
dance here this night, and one of the dancers has
been found dead, apparently poisoned.”</p>

<p>And now I might well find myself trembling all
over, and have to lean against the wall to recover
myself. I only just succeeded in keeping back a cry
of consternation. For it was to go to that underground<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
club, with its dark reputation, and its strange
character of mingled fashion and depravity, that I
had been tempted to quit my post that night. I had
been one of those masked dancers, jostling with I
knew not whom under the shadowy lights and in the
curtained recesses of the pretended studio in London’s
nearest approach to a Quartier Latin. I could
recall the scene in the after-midnight hours, the sea
of black silk-covered faces thronging under the crimson
lamp-shades, the bizarre confusion of costumes,
monks and Crusaders, columbines and queens, the
swish of silk and tinkling of swords and bracelets,
and the incessant flood of whispers that had made me
think of the scene in Milton’s pandemonium when the
assembly of fallen angels are suddenly deprived of
speech and changed into hissing serpents.</p>

<p>I had used the greatest precautions in coming and
going. I had no reason to think that there was any
real likelihood of my presence there being discovered.
But a cold fear laid hold of me as I steadied
my nerves to deal with the Police Inspector who had
so unexpectedly conjured up a spectre on the scene
of that past revelry. It was doubly imperative now
that I should make no mistake, and above all that I
should get rid of every sign that I had not passed the
night in my own bed.</p>

<p>I was fast unbuttoning my shirt as I spoke again
to the waiting police officer.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I can’t awake Sir Frank for that.
It seems to be a case that he will expect me to attend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
myself. Is there anything peculiar about the medical
symptoms? What does your local surgeon say?”</p>

<p>Inspector Charles at last revealed the true reason
for his persistence in demanding the attendance of
my chief.</p>

<p>“I haven’t called in our local surgeon. There
doesn’t seem anything mysterious about the cause of
death. It looks to me like a simple case of opium-poisoning,
very likely a suicide. But the case must
be disposed of <i>in camera</i> if possible, for the sake of
the people in high places connected with the club.
My information is that there was a royalty present
at this dance, the Crown Prince of——”</p>

<p>Whether purposely or not, the speaker let his
voice drop so low that I failed to catch the final word.
But I had heard enough. There could be no more
doubt that Tarleton must be informed. It was a bare
possibility that the victim might prove to be the foreign
Royal Highness himself. Failing that, it might
at least be someone who had been mistaken for him
by the assassin. In any case I could thank my stars
for the intimation that the case was likely to be
hushed up on his account. Provided that I could
efface every sign of my nocturnal expedition, I ought
to have nothing now to dread.</p>

<p>I bade the officer wait, and tore off my remaining
garments, slipped into my sleeping-suit and dressing-gown,
and rumpled my hair to give myself the
look of one just roused from sleep. Then and not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
before, I ventured out upon the landing to face
my chief.</p>

<p>As I did so I was chilled by another shock. I
saw a thin line of light under the door in front of
me. Sir Frank Tarleton was awake.</p>

<p>I don’t think I can be accused of cowardice for
feeling as I did during those desperate moments. It
was not only my worldly fortune that was at stake;
there were peculiar circumstances which made it
doubly shameful on my part to be false to the trust
put in me by the great specialist. They went back
to the day when I began to attend his lectures on
forensic medicine at the University College in Gower
Street. I had already taken my medical degree in
the University of London with a view to becoming
a public analyst, and I had been anxious to profit
by the Professor’s unique knowledge of poisons.
From the first I had attracted his favourable notice;
my papers had won his praise; and he had invited
me to call on him, and admitted me to his friendship.
Then, at the end of the year’s course, he had overwhelmed
me by an offer so much beyond my hopes
that I could scarcely yet believe in my good luck.</p>

<p>I can see him now, the whole scene is clear before
me, the brisk figure with its face of intense thought,
crowned by a shock of unkempt gray hair, standing
over me on the hearth-rug of his dingy consulting-room
on the ground floor in Montague Street. He
was following his quaint habit of swinging his magnificent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
gold repeater in front of him by its shabby
scrap of ribbon, while he gave me the amazing news.</p>

<p>“I’ve decided to take an assistant, Cassilis. I
have passed my sixtieth birthday, and though my
work interests me as much as ever, I mean to spare
myself a little more in future. I don’t intend to
turn out in the middle of the night because a bilious
duchess fancies that someone has bribed her French
maid to poison her. And I’ve told them at the Home
Office—I suppose you know I’m their principal consultant—that
I won’t be sent down to Cornwall one
day and to Cumberland the next every time a coroner
lets himself be puzzled by a simple case of
strychnine or arsenic. It’s work for a younger man.”</p>

<p>He waved the watch towards me as he went on.</p>

<p>“Sir James Ponsonby—that’s the Permanent
Under Secretary—has consented to my having a
deputy, and I’m submitting your name.”</p>

<p>I recall my sensations as he stopped abruptly and
bent his keen eyes on me from beneath their bushy
roof of eyebrow to see how the proposal struck me.
I had gasped for breath then as I was gasping now.
At the age of twenty-five, only just qualified for my
profession, I was to be lifted at one step out of the
struggling crowd into a position which was already
success, and which I should only have to make proper
use of to attain in time the same eminence as
my patron.</p>

<p>My answer must have been incoherent. But
Tarleton interrupted it with a jerk of his gold repeater,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
which, I can remember, almost made me duck
my head.</p>

<p>“I’m paying you what most of the men in our
profession would consider a doubtful compliment
when I tell you that you seem to me to be a young
man with imagination, Cassilis. And that is what’s
wanted in my work. It isn’t doctor’s work really so
much as detective’s. It’s not only symptoms I have
to look for, but motives. There was a touch in your
very first paper that showed me you could think for
yourself, and speculate. And speculation is the master
key of science, although all your second-rate men
decry it. It’s the old fable of the fox who had lost
his tail. Not having any imagination themselves,
they would like to forbid it to everyone. The Trade
Unions rule the world to-day, and they are all trying
to reduce the intelligence of mankind to the lowest
common denominator.”</p>

<p>He had spoken with a certain bitterness which
it was easy for me to understand. Eminent as he
was, unquestioned as his authority had now become,
I knew that Tarleton was not popular with the medical
profession. His baronetcy had been given late,
and given grudgingly. Perhaps he had recognized
in me something that reminded him of his own
youth, and had taken a generous resolution to help
me in consequence. Certainly his treatment of me
since had been more like that of a father than an
employer.</p>

<p>He had said a good deal more that I hadn’t forgotten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
and that I was least likely to forget just then.
His manner had been very grave as he dwelt upon
the confidential character of a great deal of his work.</p>

<p>“If you are to assist me in my most important
cases, and to qualify yourself for succeeding me later
on, as I hope you will, you must learn to be more
discreet than in almost any other line of life. You
will find yourself in possession of secrets that compromise
the honour of great families; men in the
highest positions will hold their reputations at your
mercy; the safety of the State itself may sometimes
depend on your silence. I know of at least one man
sitting in the House of Lords who owes his peerage
to an undiscovered murder; and what is more,
he knows of my knowledge. I make it a rule if
possible never to go into any company where he is
likely to be present, and he takes the same care to
avoid me. But if he ever thought it necessary to his
safety, that man would no more hesitate about taking
my life than he did about taking his nephew’s—a
boy twelve years old.”</p>

<p>No doubt Tarleton had gauged my disposition
pretty well before he chose me for his assistant, and
he knew that I should be more attracted than repelled
by such hints as that. My blood tingled at the prospect
opening before me. The days of Richard III
and the Bloody Tower seemed to have come again.
And I was to be behind the scenes tracing the midnight
assassin at his work in the heart of modern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
London, and in the very purlieus of her palaces. It
was enough to sate the greediest imagination.</p>

<p>“I mustn’t conceal from you,” my kindly chief
had gone on to tell me, “that I have had to overcome
strong objections to your appointment. Sir James
Ponsonby considers that you are very young to be
entrusted with such serious responsibilities. You
can’t wonder if the Home Office has taken some precautions.
I submitted your name a month ago, and
I only received permission to make you the offer
yesterday. I have very little doubt that you have
been under observation most of the time between.”</p>

<p>This was the part of the conversation that had
come back to me most vividly that night when I was
struggling frantically towards the accusing bell.</p>

<p>For the whole sting in the communication that
my memory thrust so pitilessly before me was in the
last condition, the very condition I had been driven
to break that night.</p>

<p>I had been less dismayed than most men of my
age perhaps—particularly most medical students—would
have been by learning that my life had been
under the microscope for a month. I had nothing
very serious to reproach myself with. The memory
of a secret love affair, an unhappy one, alas! had
served to keep me clear of the most dangerous of all
the snares that life sets for youth. It was my good
luck never to have tasted, and never to have felt the
wish to taste, anything in the way of alcohol, and to
be able to sit with nothing stronger than a cup of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
strong coffee in front of me in the midst of the most
riotous company. I believe it was this exceptional
merit that turned the scale in my favour with Sir
James Ponsonby. Gambling had equally little appeal
for me, and I took no interest whatever in that
noble animal the horse. My real vice was love of
excitement for its own sake. One prize-fight had
more attraction for me than a hundred cricket-matches.
It was in search of sensation that I was
drawn into the night life of London. I was haunted
by the mystery of silent streets and shadowed courts.
Like Stevenson, I felt that life ought to be a series
of adventures beginning in Leicester Square. The
Press Club and the Chelsea Art Club were the two
poles of my romantic sphere, and I revelled in the
society of men who seemed to me to be leading lives
more mysterious than mine.</p>

<p>It appeared that this was the weakness which
stood in my way with the Government Department
I was to serve. Tarleton had ceased to swing his
watch, and had given me a very meaning glance as
he came to the decisive point.</p>

<p>“Sir James has made it a condition of your
appointment that it shall be a resident one. You will
have to take up your quarters with me. I shall have
a telephone installed in your room for you to take
the night calls. And I shall depend on you not to
trouble me with them unless I am really wanted.”</p>

<p>My face must have fallen as I listened to this
stipulation, for I saw an answering shade on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
doctor’s brow. I felt that a good deal of the gilt
would be taken off the gingerbread if I had to surrender
my personal freedom and abandon my favourite
haunts to lead a regular life under my employer’s
roof, and under his surveillance; for, of course, that
was what it came to. My chief inducement to take
up the career of an analyst instead of a general practitioner
had been the greater freedom I should enjoy.
I had dreaded the idea of having to settle in a provincial
town or a prim residential suburb, where I
should have to keep regular hours, go to church in
a black coat on Sundays, act as sidesman, and generally
put on all the airs of respectability. It would
be almost as great a wrench to give up my artist and
journalist friends, in whose company I had had such
jolly times, and go to bed every night just as the
real day was beginning, under the watchful eyes of
my chief.</p>

<p>I fancy Sir Frank himself felt some sympathy
with me, though he was too wise to express it.</p>

<p>“A man must expect to be judged to some
extent by the company he keeps,” he had hinted.
“You can’t expect the head of a Department like
the Home Office to feel easy at the idea of entrusting
important secrets to a young man who spends his
nights, I won’t say in disreputable company, but at
all events in circles where a good many adventurers
are found. These people”—the bitter note came
back into his voice—“these people hate the shoulders
on which they have climbed. They govern the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
empire which the Raleighs and the Clives have gained
for them, but they don’t want any more Clives and
Raleighs. They threw Burton away; they wouldn’t
use Gordon till it was too late—Faugh!” He swallowed
his disgust with an effort, and became almost
stern. “Now, my boy, this is a great opportunity
for you, and you must take it. You must forget that
you are a genius, and put your neck into the collar
for a few years. At the end of that time you will
have a reputation, and you can do what you like
within reasonable limits. I expect you to trust yourself
to me.”</p>

<p>And, of course, I had. He had taken me to the
Home Office and formally presented me to the Under
Secretary, and I found myself appointed an Assistant
Medical Adviser, detailed for duty under the
orders of Sir Frank Tarleton, with a salary that
seemed riches in advance.</p>

<p>Perhaps I had found my work a little disappointing
since. The night calls had not been numerous,
and they had grown fewer after the first month or
two, as though Tarleton’s clients or patients, I
hardly know which to call them, had found out that
it was no use expecting him to turn out any longer,
if the case was one that I could deal with. Most of
my time was passed in the laboratory in Montague
Street, carrying out analyses under his directions,
and improving my knowledge of rare poisons, of
which he had formed what was probably the finest
collection in the world. But of really sensational<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
cases, involving criminal suspicion and mystery,
there had not been one before that fateful summons
from the Domino Club.</p>

<p>But I dared not hesitate longer in delivering it.
Every moment now would only make matters worse.
I crossed the landing and knocked firmly on the
closed door.</p>

<p>The answer was instantaneous—“Come in!”</p>

<p>I obeyed, to find myself in the full glare of the
electric light over the bed, in which Tarleton was
sitting upright, his beloved repeater in one hand,
while he gazed at me questioningly from beneath his
knitted brows.</p>

<p>“I first heard the telephone nine minutes ago.
You have taken some time to answer it.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

THE EVIDENCE OF MADAME BONNELL</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Instead</span> of excusing myself I thought it the best
plan to plunge into the account of what had taken
place at the Domino Club, in the hope that it would
absorb his mind. The alert physician made only one
comment as I finished.</p>

<p>“A case for Inspector Charles is pretty sure to
be a case for me; but you didn’t know that.” He
was out of bed the next moment.</p>

<p>“Please tell him I am coming at once, and order
round my car. And be ready yourself as soon as
you can.”</p>

<p>I needed no injunction to make haste. I was
in a fever to be back at the scene of that masked
revel, and find out what had happened there. I
congratulated myself on the care I had taken to
cover my own tracks. I had left the doctor’s house
and returned to it in my ordinary clothes. Not a
soul in the Domino Club, except the member from
whom I had obtained a ticket of admission, could
have the least idea of my identity. So far as I
could see I was absolutely secure from discovery.
But it had been a dangerous game to play, and Tarleton
was a dangerous man to play against. With all
his kindness for me I trembled at the thought of coming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
within the range of his uncanny powers of
detection.</p>

<p>As soon as I had dispatched his messages, and
put a pot of coffee on to boil over a little spirit
stove, I sluiced my head in cold water, and got into
my clothes again as quickly as I had got out of them.
I was ready with a steaming cup of coffee for my
chief as he came out of his room, and was rewarded
by the heartiness with which he gulped it down. His
square leather bag, fitted with everything likely to be
needed for the treatment of a poisoning case, was
always kept ready in his bedroom, and he had it in
his hand. I relieved him of it not presuming to
bring my own; and we found the car waiting for us
when we opened the front door.</p>

<p>As we rolled through the streets, just beginning
to show signs of life, Tarleton acquainted me with
the personality of Inspector Charles.</p>

<p>“He’s a retired Army man; he likes to be called
Captain Charles. He’s also the younger son of
a peer but he doesn’t like that noticed. His family
are silly enough to object to his being in the
police, and he drops the Honourable on their account.
But of course it’s known in the Yard, and he gets
most of the society jobs in consequence. I suppose
they think he’s more likely to know his way about
among the big people. But if you ask me, I think
an experienced valet knows ten times more. You’ll
find Charles straight, and you’ll find him thorough,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
but you needn’t expect him to see an inch beyond his
own nose.”</p>

<p>This was comfortable for me. But the next
words of my chief gave me an awkward jar.</p>

<p>“By the way, you ought to be able to tell me
something about the place we’re going to—what is
it?—the Domino Club. It sounds like the sort of
night haunt the Home Office objected to so much
when I asked for you as my assistant.”</p>

<p>I had to make up my mind in a hurry. To tell
the truth was out of the question. It was not only
my own honour and safety that were at stake; there
was another for whose sake my presence at that
fatal dance must be concealed. I was on the point
of denying all knowledge of the club when it struck
me that I might be betrayed into some unconscious
movement in going through the premises, or some
thoughtless remark, which would reveal to a keen
intelligence like Tarleton’s that I had been there
before.</p>

<p>I made an effort to seem as if I had been searching
my memory.</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said slowly, “now you speak of it I
remember having been there. But I am not sure
that I am free to say anything about it. My impression
is that there was an implied pledge of secrecy.
Everyone wore a mask and a disguise of some sort.
It was supposed to be a place where people in very
high positions could let themselves go in security. I
was told there were sometimes judges present, and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
rather think Cabinet Ministers, as well as peeresses,
and so forth.”</p>

<p>The specialist nodded gravely. “I expect the
authorities knew what they were doing when they
told Charles to call for me. We shall see whether
he has found out who the man is that has been
poisoned.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t say it was a man,” I ventured to
suggest.</p>

<p>Sir Frank pursed his lips, but made no answer.
He took out his gold repeater and began swinging
it slowly, a sure sign that he was following out some
train of thought.</p>

<p>In another quarter of an hour the car drew up
in one of the old-fashioned streets of Chelsea between
King Street and the Fulham Road, at the
entrance to the curious building or group of buildings
that bore the name of Vincent Studios.</p>

<p>The place resembled a rabbit warren. A short
flight of steps led down from the street pavement
into a dark, cavernous hall with doors opening out
of it on three sides. Behind most of these doors
were the studios of artists—one or two of them
known to me—studios as cavernous if not as dark
as the hall, and ending in glass doors that opened
on mysterious gardens or garden yards overgrown
with nasturtiums and other plants that seem to love
the grime and cinders of suburban London. In the
background one was aware of gray piles of timber,
as of a mountain range closing a landscape. Some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
forgotten builder, perhaps, had died, leaving those
stacks behind him, and his heirs had never discovered
their existence, so that they had been left to the
possession of the rats.</p>

<p>At the far end of the entrance cavern two doors
side by side still bore the name of artists, one of
whom had lately blossomed into an Academician and
been transplanted to the sunnier region of Bedford
Park, while the other had exchanged the brush for
some more promising weapon in what, I fear, had
been a losing fight with Fortune. Only the initiated
knew that the door still bearing the name of J.
Loftus, A.R.A., was now that of the Domino Club;
while its companion, from which the name of Yelverton
had been roughly effaced, served as a back
door for the use of the tradesmen and servants of the
club, and also for such members as had reasons of
their own for not coming through the streets in fancy
costume. For their benefit a row of small dressing-rooms
had been fitted up, in which they could
transform themselves from sober moths into bright
artificial butterflies and back again.</p>

<p>In front of the club entrance an officer in plain
clothes was stationed who recognized Sir Frank with
a respectful salute.</p>

<p>“You will find Inspector Charles inside, sir,” he
said, opening the door for us.</p>

<p>We found ourselves in a dark narrow passage
empty of everything but cloak- and hat-pegs. A door<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
at the further end opened straight into the dancing-room.</p>

<p>The former studio had been decorated in a fashion
evidently meant to recall the Arabian Nights
Entertainment. Vistas of Moorish arches and fountains
playing among palms and oleanders had been
painted on the walls. At intervals wooden columns
had been set up to support curtains of gauze embroidered
so as to afford a half concealment to the nooks
that they enclosed. The whole place was still suffused
with the lurid glow of a series of red lanterns
hanging from the roof. But a glass door at the
further end had been thrown open to admit the daylight,
and where it reached the crimson glow became
haggard and spectral and the whole place had the air
of an old woman’s face from which the paint had
peeled in streaks, revealing the wrinkles and sharp
bones beneath.</p>

<p>Inspector Charles, tall, upright, and looking the
personification of law and order, stood beside one
of the curtained alcoves close to the garden door, and
invited us with a solemn gesture to approach.</p>

<p>This was the moment I had been dreading. I
endeavoured to keep my face passive, and give no
sign of recognition, as I came behind my chief and
took my first glance at the spectacle the Inspector
had to show us.</p>

<p>Within the curtains, stretched at full length on a
low divan, was a figure attired as an Inquisitor. The
black robe was folded carefully round him, but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
peaked hood with its two eye-slits had been thrust
back over the head, so that the face was fully
exposed. It was a striking face in every way, the
face of a man of fifty or thereabout in the full possession
of his powers. The forehead was intellectual;
the eyes, wide open but glazed in the death
stare, must have been full and penetrating in life;
the nose and chin were strongly carved; only the lips
showed a certain looseness, as of over-ripened fruit,
that seemed to hint at something evil underlying
the dignity and strength manifested in the rest of
the face.</p>

<p>I scanned that prostrate figure with painful curiosity.
The costume was only too familiar; I had had
ample opportunity of observing it during the night
that had just elapsed. But the face was as strange
to me as it was to either of the other two who stood
and gazed beside me. Even the eyes, unnaturally
dilated by the drug, seemed to bear little likeness to
those that had peered through the holes in the black
hood when I last looked on the sombre shape in life.</p>

<p>The Inspector spoke briefly, addressing himself
to my companion.</p>

<p>“This is how he was found when they came in to
put out the lights after everyone was gone as they
supposed. They thought at first that he was in a
drunken sleep, and tried to rouse him by shaking.
When they failed, they went to bring Madame Bonnell,
the proprietress of the club. They dared not
uncover the face without her authority; the rules of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
the club are so strict on that point. She laid back
the hood herself, and saw at once that he was dead.
After that she rang us up, and saw that the body
was not touched till I got here. I thought it best not
to touch it myself till you came.”</p>

<p>Clear, succinct, containing the bare facts and
nothing more, such was the report of Inspector
Charles. It was evident that no better man could
have been put in charge of an affair in dealing with
which prudence was the most essential requisite.</p>

<p>The great physician received the statement with
a nod of satisfaction.</p>

<p>“You suggested to Dr. Cassilis over the wire
that it looked like a case of opium-poisoning,” was
his first remark.</p>

<p>Captain Charles favoured me with a cautious
glance, in which I read some disapproval of my
youthful appearance.</p>

<p>“I thought an opiate must have been the cause
of death, Sir Frank, because there was no sign of
a struggle nor of any suffering. He seemed to have
died in his sleep.”</p>

<p>Again the consultant gave an approving nod.
All this time he had not once removed his eyes
from the pallid face on which a leaden tinge had
become visible. Now he turned to me.</p>

<p>“What do you say, Cassilis?”</p>

<p>I shook my head. There was something in the
case that puzzled me.</p>

<p>“I agree with Captain Charles to some extent.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
The appearances are consistent with opium-poisoning.
But——” I turned to the Inspector—“can you
tell us the hour at which the body was found with
life extinct?”</p>

<p>Captain Charles consulted his watch. Tarleton’s
fingers were already pinching the shabby ribbon of
his repeater, and it was going to and fro with the
slow movement of a pendulum.</p>

<p>“It is now half-past six. I got here soon after
five. It must have been about half-past four when
the body was found.”</p>

<p>I looked questioningly at the great specialist.</p>

<p>“Unless the opiate was given very early, in which
case the effect would surely have been noticed by
someone, it must have been a very powerful dose to
produce death so soon. I should be inclined to suspect
some weakness in the heart, or some other
derangement, to account for such rapid action. I
don’t like the colour of the skin.”</p>

<p>“Ah! You see that?” Tarleton bent over the
dead face in grave scrutiny for some moments. Then
he straightened himself up.</p>

<p>“And now, who is this man?” he asked the
Inspector.</p>

<p>“His name is Wilson, so the proprietress says.
But she seems to know very little about him.”</p>

<p>“Wilson?” The doctor repeated the name with
a sceptical intonation. “That is the sort of name
that man would be likely to give himself in a place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
of this kind, I should think. Can I see the proprietress?”</p>

<p>Captain Charles went out in quest of her. He
was no sooner gone than my chief whispered quickly
in my ear, “Not another word about the cause of
death before anybody else. I blame myself for asking
your opinion. I underrated your powers of
observation. Hush!”</p>

<p>I looked round to see a capable middle-aged
Frenchwoman dressed in black silk, emerging from a
portière across the room. Very capable and businesslike
she looked, with her well-arranged hair and
commanding black eyes, and well-preserved face and
figure, and that amazing air of respectability which
only a Frenchwoman can keep up in an atmosphere
charged with evil. In Madame Bonnell’s presence
vice was deprived of its impropriety, and even murder
took on the character of a business mischance
about which the less fuss made the better.</p>

<p>Madame had obviously employed her time since
the discovery of this particular mischance in making
the best of her personal appearance. She greeted
us with affability.</p>

<p>Even Tarleton, I thought, was softened by her
graceful and yet dignified deportment. In a moment
we seemed to become four friends engaged in a confidential
talk over a matter of common interest. It
was Madame who induced me to sit down.</p>

<p>“You understand, no doubt, Madame, that we
are not here with any hostile purpose,” the representative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
of the Home Office began. “If it is possible
to dispose of this matter privately, without
involving you or your establishment in any scandal,
I shall be glad.”</p>

<p>The explanation seemed unnecessary. Madame
Bonnell by her manner refused to perceive the possibility
of her being involved in scandal, or in anything
else inconsistent with the character of a
respectable business woman.</p>

<p>“You have identified the deceased, I understand,
by the name of Wilson. Have you any idea whether
that was his real name, or an assumed one?”</p>

<p>Madame Bonnell had no idea. Madame Bonnell
was desolated by having no idea, since the amiable
Sir Frank seemed to wish her to have one. Monsieur
the late Wilson had introduced himself to her
originally under that name, and she had never
inquired if he had any other.</p>

<p>Madame succeeded in conveying to us that she
was not in the habit of inconveniencing her patrons
by inquiries of any sort, or of distracting her own
mind by curiosity on any subject except their ability
to pay her.</p>

<p>Under the polished surface of indifference I nevertheless
thought I could detect in the proprietress
of the Domino Club a consciousness that she was
being examined by the representatives of the law
about a serious business, and that it would not be
prudent on her part to withhold any material information.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
It must have been clear to her that candour
was her best policy, up to a certain point at all events.</p>

<p>To Tarleton’s next question, how she came to
make the acquaintance of the dead man, she made
a pretty full reply. Monsieur Wilson had introduced
himself to her a year or two before, when she was
managing a small restaurant in Soho, in a street in
which there is more than one small restaurant, and
the restaurants are patronized by more than one class
of customers. It was Monsieur Wilson who had
proposed to her that she should exchange her position
there for the more profitable one of proprietress
of a fashionable night club. Monsieur had offered
to provide the funds required for starting such a
club, and had undertaken to make it fashionable, and
in both respects he had kept his word. All the first
members of the club had been brought by him, and he
had gone on introducing others since. Madame
avowed that she was under a debt to Monsieur Wilson,
which she could not easily repay. She made an
effort to repay it, as she spoke, with tears for his
fate, but the dividend forthcoming did not strike me
as a heavy one. By this time, doubtless, the Domino
Club was fairly on its feet, and in no great need of
the dead man’s further support.</p>

<p>Madame Bonnell’s evidence so far had only served
to deepen the mystery instead of lightening it.
Who was this unknown Wilson? Why should he have
wanted to start a night club, and what was the influence
that had enabled him to fill it with so many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
members drawn from the highest social ranks? The
chief part in the examination had been taken by the
physician, Inspector Charles intervening mostly to
secure dates and addresses for his note-book after the
meticulous fashion of the law. At length I took
advantage of a break to put a question which had
been in my mind for some time.</p>

<p>“These people whom Wilson, if that was his
name, brought into the club must have been his
friends, apparently. So far as one can see the club
was entirely composed of his personal friends and
other friends of theirs. Doesn’t that make it more
probable that he took poison himself than that anyone
else gave it to him?”</p>

<p>I threw out the suggestion generally, and my
three companions all turned and stared at me as
though it took them by surprise, although it was an
obvious alternative. The physician said nothing, but
the compression of his brows told me plainly that
he had rejected such a theory. Captain Charles made
a fatal objection.</p>

<p>“After he had founded the club and done everything
to make it a success, why should he have come
to it to commit suicide—the very thing that would
damage it most?”</p>

<p>Madame Bonnell became genuinely agitated for
the first time.</p>

<p>“But of course that will not be known!” she
exclaimed sharply. “You sir,” she appealed to
Tarleton, “you will know how to contrive that this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
unfortunate shall be taken elsewhere. Think of the
scandal if it should be known that a crime was committed
in the presence of the Crown Prince!”</p>

<p>Evidently His Royal Highness was a strong card
in Madame’s estimation, and one which she could
rely on to win her game. Perhaps it was not the
first time in her business experience that she had
found the police disposed to shut their eyes to awkward
incidents in which great personages were
involved.</p>

<p>The consultant of the Home Office looked by no
means yielding.</p>

<p>“I have not yet decided what course I shall
recommend the authorities to take,” he said. “Have
you anything to say in answer to Dr. Cassilis? Is
he right in assuming that everyone present here last
night must have been Wilson’s friend?”</p>

<p>Thus pressed, Madame Bonnell presented the
appearance of an unwilling witness, who hesitates
to speak for fear of the consequences to himself.</p>

<p>“As long as I believe that no proceedings will be
taken against the Club, which is my property, everything
I know, my suspicions even, are at the service
of the police,” she replied cautiously.</p>

<p>It was a bargain which the astute Frenchwoman
was proposing openly to the authorities. Tarleton
shrugged his shoulders. He was the last man to
commit himself to anything of the kind.</p>

<p>“The moment I am satisfied that you are withholding
any information that bears on the case I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
shall advise the police to close this place, and apply
for your deportation as an alien, Madame Bonnell.”</p>

<p>The capable Frenchwoman saw that she had made
a false step. She retracted it immediately in admirable
distress.</p>

<p>“But Monsieur must pardon me! I am bewildered
by the situation in which I find myself. I do
not understand the Britannic law. I am ready to
throw myself on Monsieur’s consideration. What
is it that he would have me say?”</p>

<p>The physician looked at his watch.</p>

<p>“I am waiting for your answer to Dr. Cassilis.”</p>

<p>Madame Bonnell gave me an appealing look, of
which I thought it best to take no notice. I had seen
nothing of her during the time I had spent at the
dance, and I was confident that she was quite ignorant
of my presence at it. She found herself compelled
to speak without assistance.</p>

<p>“The Doctor Cassilis is mistaken,” she said at
last, with an air of weighing each word before she
uttered it. “Monsieur Wilson was acquainted with
the people whom he introduced here, undoubtedly,
but they were not all his friends. On the contrary,
some of them were his enemies, and he went in fear
of them. Even in mortal fear.”</p>

<p>It was the revelation Tarleton seemed to have
been anticipating. He gave the short, satisfied nod
I knew so well.</p>

<p>“Go on,” he commanded. “Explain how you
knew this.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>“In effect I knew it because he told me so himself.
He took me into his confidence in order to
ask for my protection. He feared this very thing
that has happened. He instructed me to pour out
everything he was to drink with my own hands, and
to send it to him by the waiter he thought he could
trust—Gerard.”</p>

<p>“Now I think we have some real information,”
the specialist observed. “Be good enough to send
for Gerard, if you please.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

THE EVIDENCE OF THE DEAD</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">At this</span> point I began to feel a touch of nervousness.
I had faced the proprietress of the Domino
Club without any, because she had not seen me even
in my disguise. But the waiters had been going to
and fro throughout the night. I had given orders
once or twice, and I could not feel certain that my
voice would not be recognized. I told myself that
my fear was fanciful, and that the last thing that
could occur to anyone’s mind was that a representative
of the Home Office, engaged in the investigation,
had himself been present on the scene of the
crime, if crime it was. But none the less I resolved
to do nothing to attract the waiter’s notice, if I
could help it.</p>

<p>I saw Tarleton frown as Madame Bonnell returned
with her servant. He gave her an authoritative
nod.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Madame. I won’t detain you while
I am questioning this man.”</p>

<p>The prudent Frenchwoman concealed any vexation
she may have felt, and instantly retired, leaving
Gerard alone with us.</p>

<p>He was as much the type of the discreet waiter
as Madame was of the discreet manageress. If he
had only possessed side-whiskers he would have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
the perfect waiter of the French stage. But he was
a good deal younger than Madame, and showed less
self-possession. His eyes searched us nervously
in turn as though he were looking for someone to
propitiate. The physician read his rather white face
with one swift glance, and came to his relief.</p>

<p>“You are not under any suspicion, Gerard. Provided
you tell the truth, you have nothing to fear.”</p>

<p>The waiter braced himself up with a visible
effort. Not, I fancied, that he had any objection to
tell the truth, but that it was a rather novel exercise
for him. From that moment he neglected the
Inspector and me to concentrate his efforts to propitiate
on Sir Frank.</p>

<p>“I hear that the man who is dead trusted you.
Did he trust you with his real name?”</p>

<p>“Never, sir.” Gerard spread out his two hands
to show their emptiness of knowledge. “I knew
nothing of him except what I learned from
Madame.”</p>

<p>“And that was?”</p>

<p>The waiter looked apprehensive. No doubt the
idea crossed his mind that it might be awkward if
his account contradicted hers.</p>

<p>“That was very little indeed, sir. She told me
to treat him as proprietor. He never paid for what
he consumed. I supposed that he was Madame’s
partner.”</p>

<p>“Were you the only man who waited on him?”</p>

<p>“For the last four months or six months, yes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
sir. He made it his request to Madame and to me
that I should bring him everything he ordered.”</p>

<p>“Did he tell you why?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he said to me that I was to carry his glass
of wine or his cup of coffee very carefully. ‘See
that you do not spill it, and see that nothing is
spilled into it by the way’—those were his words,
sir, as nearly as I can recollect.”</p>

<p>“What did you think when he said that?”</p>

<p>Gerard’s expressive hands mutely protested that
it was not their business to think.</p>

<p>“I do what I am ordered to do, sir, without
thinking too much. But Monsieur Wilson himself
explained his motive to me. He said, ‘I do not like to
have practical jokes played on me, and I fancy there
are some practical jokers in the <i>cercle</i>.’”</p>

<p>“Did he say <i>cercle</i> or club?”</p>

<p>“Monsieur, he always spoke to me in French.
He had spent much time in Paris, he told me once.
I believe——” Gerard interrupted himself, as
though doubtful whether his belief would be acceptable
as evidence. It struck me that he had been a
witness in a court of law at some time or other.</p>

<p>Tarleton threw him a friendly nod. “Go on;
tell me what you believe.”</p>

<p>“I think,” Gerard corrected himself, “that perhaps
Monsieur Wilson founded this club in order
to escape the necessity for going to Paris to amuse
himself.”</p>

<p>The examiner moved his head doubtfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>“You think he had some business, then, which
made it necessary for him to remain in London.”</p>

<p>“But I am sure of it!” The waiter’s tone became
confident. “Business that assisted him in establishing
the club, even. The great people who came here
were his customers rather than his personal friends;
such is my idea.”</p>

<p>Tarleton turned an approving face to us.</p>

<p>“I think that this man knows what he is talking
about. We are dealing with something very daring
and very dark. Did you ever guess what the business
was?”</p>

<p>The question was darted out suddenly. But the
little Frenchman manifested no uneasiness. The
doctor’s praise seemed to have given him confidence.</p>

<p>“I supposed sometimes that it was not a lawful
business, sir.” He lowered his voice a little and
glanced behind him as if to make sure that his
employer was not within hearing. “I fancied that
Monsieur Wilson might be the proprietor of an
establishment for the reception of ladies who did not
wish to become mothers.”</p>

<p>I could not resist a slight shudder as the gruesome
hint came glibly from the lips of the pasty-faced
waiter. He did not look the kind of man who
would have made any objection to a post in such
an establishment.</p>

<p>“Some of the ladies whom he introduced here
had the air of being afraid of him, I thought,” Gerard
added by way of confirmation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>Inspector Charles had begun to take notes of this
evidence. He now straightened himself up, and
looked at Tarleton.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t it be well to search his clothes, Sir
Frank? We might find an address, perhaps?”</p>

<p>“In another minute. Is there any question you
would like to put, Cassilis?”</p>

<p>I had to make a call on my courage, as Gerard
faced towards me in readiness to be addressed. His
figure was not less familiar to me than that of the
masked Inquisitor had been. I was now to see
whether my voice would sound familiar to him. I
dared not modify my usual tone with Tarleton’s keen
ears listening.</p>

<p>“We have heard that a royal personage was here
last night,” I said slowly and distinctly, and then
paused to note the effect.</p>

<p>At my first words Gerard’s watery eyes grew
wider for an instant and I feared the worst. Some
note must have been struck in the echoing cells of
his memory. But the next moment reassured me.
Out of the many hundred voices with which a
waiter’s memory must be stored, how should he be
able to identify one which he had heard say scarcely
a dozen words? The man’s face was a perfect blank
again before I went on.</p>

<p>“Can you tell us if there were any other strangers
present?” I asked boldly. And turning to my chief
and the Inspector, I explained, “It seems to me just
possible that an attempt may have been planned on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
the life of the Crown Prince, and that this man may
have been mistaken for him.”</p>

<p>Tarleton did not reject this suggestion so decidedly
as the theory of suicide. I saw a thoughtful
expression come on his face, as though he was
engaged in trying to adjust the idea with another
one previously in his mind. Captain Charles took up
the scent quite eagerly.</p>

<p>“Do you know what disguise His Royal Highness
was wearing?” he demanded.</p>

<p>The waiter hesitated and then shook his head.</p>

<p>“I had my suspicion, sir, but Madame can tell
you for certain.”</p>

<p>The Inspector was satisfied with the answer. But
Tarleton’s voice rang out sharply.</p>

<p>“Let us have your suspicion, please.”</p>

<p>Gerard had the air of a man who had committed
himself, and regrets it.</p>

<p>“Milor,”—he had been sharp enough to notice
the Inspector’s use of a title in addressing the consultant—“I
particularly noticed one person who
appeared to me a stranger who did not very well
know his way about the club, and who appeared to
have some business with Monsieur Wilson.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” Tarleton’s deep breath told me that he
felt himself on a real trail. “And how was this person
disguised?”</p>

<p>“The disguise was an extraordinary one, milor.
It was that which first attracted my notice. It was
at once the costume of a man and of a woman. That<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
is to say, the upper part was that of a warrior in
armour, and the lower part was a woman’s skirt.”</p>

<p>“Joan of Arc,” exclaimed Charles.</p>

<p>The Frenchman shrank in horror. “But, monsieur,
it could not have been Sainte Jeanne! For
instance, the helmet was Roman.”</p>

<p>“Neither did she wear a skirt with her armour,”
the physician added quietly. “It must have been
meant for Zenobia.”</p>

<p>The Inspector’s face showed so clearly that he
had never heard of the famous Queen of Palmyra
that I should have been amused if I had not been
on the rack of suspense. Fortunately, Tarleton was
now engrossed in his new line of inquiry.</p>

<p>“In spite of this feminine disguise, in spite of
the skirt, you recognized that this stranger was a
man, it seems?”</p>

<p>The eloquent hands protested again. “But no,
milor; I said I had my suspicion, that is all.
Madame——”</p>

<p>The doctor cut him short.</p>

<p>“You thought this person, Zenobia, had some
business with Wilson. Tell me, how many persons
knew that Wilson wore that disguise last night?”</p>

<p>He turned and pointed to the dead body which lay
full in view from where we were seated. Gerard let
his eyes follow the gesture and withdrew them with
a sickly twinge.</p>

<p>“Everyone knew it, I think. It was the disguise
he wore invariably in the club. It was as if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
he came here to meet his clients, and it was necessary
for them to know that they were speaking to him.”</p>

<p>Sir Frank Tarleton nodded more than once this
time. He evidently felt himself to be getting a firm
grip on the problem. I admired the sagacity he had
shown in transferring his examination from the proprietress
of the club to the waiter. Gerard was
proving a much easier witness to deal with than
Madame Bonnell. He had not so much at stake.</p>

<p>“And now,” the consultant pursued, “perhaps
you can tell us if there were any other persons who
showed a desire to meet Wilson last night?”</p>

<p>Gerard brightened up visibly.</p>

<p>“But certainly, milor. There was one in particular
who never seemed to take her eyes off him.
She danced with him time after time, and when
she was not dancing with him herself she watched
those who did.”</p>

<p>“And how was she dressed?”</p>

<p>“Milor, she was hardly dressed at all.” Gerard
may have feared another irreverent guess from Captain
Charles, for he added quickly: “I heard Monsieur
address her as Salome.”</p>

<p>The Inspector was again busy with his note-book.
But Sir Frank struck me as not being quite so deeply
interested in Salome as he had been in Zenobia.</p>

<p>“And there was also a lady whose costume it is
not easy to describe.” Gerard was going on of his
own accord now, as though his interest had been
kindled in the inquiry. “Part of it was a leopard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
skin. And she wore a necklace composed of claws
of the same beast, as I imagined. In my own mind
I called her the Leopardess. Without doubt, her
costume was that of an East Indian princess.”</p>

<p>Tarleton’s interest seemed to revive again at the
description of the Leopardess. Yet it was impossible
to be sure that he was not playing a part to conceal
his true opinion of all this from the witness.</p>

<p>“And this lady, did she dance much with
Wilson?”</p>

<p>Gerard gave his head an emphatic shake.</p>

<p>“She did not dance with him at all, although he
asked her more than once. I am sure of it. I was
surprised, for it was not often that he was refused.
I saw him speaking to her very earnestly, even
threateningly, but it was no use. And she left early,
long before the dance was over.”</p>

<p>The examiner shrugged his shoulders. I wondered
that he did not point out to the man that a
woman who had left early could hardly have played
any part in the tragedy. But I was beginning to
grasp that it was his method to listen much and speak
little when he was face to face with a mystery.</p>

<p>The next moment he had dismissed Gerard
abruptly, and risen to his feet. He crossed over to
the corpse, followed by Charles and myself, and
gazed intently on the exposed face. The slight leaden
tinge I had remarked was more noticeable already,
and in addition there was a slight roughness of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
skin which I understood still less. I took care this
time not to make any remark on it.</p>

<p>The specialist’s attention was concentrated on the
features and expression of the dead man. After a
moment or two he slowly shook his head.</p>

<p>“No,” he pronounced, “that is not the face of a
man degraded enough for such a business as the
waiter supposed. It is not the face of an adventurer.
This was a man of the world, in a good position, able
to meet with the people whom he brought to this
place on a footing of equality. His motives were not
sordid, perhaps, in the first place. We are dealing
with a Tiberius rather than a Tigellinus, I think.”</p>

<p>I don’t fancy those names had much more meaning
for Captain Charles than Zenobia’s. But he
acquiesced respectfully in the judgment.</p>

<p>“From all that we have heard about the Domino
Club at Scotland Yard there has never been the
slightest suggestion of crime about it,” he observed.
“One of the judges of the High Court is a member
of it. He has the reputation of being pretty fond of
women, but he certainly wouldn’t be mixed up with
anything shady.”</p>

<p>“Shaded, but not shady, eh?” Tarleton returned
with a curl of the lip. “But come, it is time to see if
the dead has any evidence to give about himself.”</p>

<p>Thrusting his gold repeater carelessly into his
pocket, he deftly stripped the body of its long Inquisitor’s
robe. Underneath was revealed an evening suit
of fine material and faultless cut with a white silk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
waistcoat and soft-fronted shirt. They were the
clothes of a man of good position, as Sir Frank had
said, and a man accustomed to respect himself. A
Bohemian would scarcely have troubled to dress himself
so carefully beneath a domino.</p>

<p>Captain Charles viewed this correct attire with
the approval of a military man. “A gentleman as
you guessed, Sir Frank.”</p>

<p>“As I inferred,” the doctor responded sharply,
“I never guess.” His capable fingers were already
exploring the pockets of the corpse. Most of them
seemed to be empty, but presently he extracted a silver
matchbox from the waistcoat, and opened it. A
low sound like a suppressed whistle came from his
tight lips as he shook out on the palm of his hand two
pellets the size of small peas.</p>

<p>Of all my experiences on that eventful night, or
rather morning, this was the most amazing. Only
by a strong effort was I able to keep my astonishment
within due bounds. Although I had thrown out the
suggestion of suicide, the last thing I had expected
was to find poison on the dead man’s person.</p>

<p>My chief passed me one of the pellets, and put
the other first to his nostrils and then to the tip of
his tongue.</p>

<p>“Well?” He motioned to me to imitate his
action.</p>

<p>There could be no doubt about the result of the
test. “Opium in a highly concentrated form, and
soluble,” I whispered hoarsely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>We exchanged looks of intense surprise. The
Inspector on his part was evidently surprised by
our attitude.</p>

<p>“Then Dr. Cassilis was right after all,” he said,
staring at us. “It was suicide?”</p>

<p>The great consultant smiled at him indulgently.</p>

<p>“I am sure that this discovery has made Dr.
Cassilis renounce that theory,” he answered. “A
man who was accustomed to take opium in such
doses as these would have to take a terrible quantity
to kill himself. And this box, is nearly full.”</p>

<p>My brain was buzzing while he spoke. Utter
darkness seemed to be settling down on my mind.
I gazed at my chief in stupefaction greater than
the Inspector’s.</p>

<p>“The problem for Dr. Cassilis and myself is
this,” he continued, addressing his explanation to
Captain Charles, although I realized that he was
speaking at least as much for my benefit. “The
corpse shows all the usual symptoms of poisoning
by opium. But if the deceased had accustomed his
system to opium it is not easy to understand how anyone
could have given him enough to produce death.
The dose must have been enormous, and he must
have detected the taste at once in any ordinary
medium such as a cup of coffee.”</p>

<p>I just managed to nod my head with assent.</p>

<p>“The inference I am inclined to draw at the
moment,” the specialist concluded, “is that Wilson
was not a taker of the drug and that these pellets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
were not intended for himself. I think it is more
probable that he carried them as weapons of self-defense.
Perhaps Salome would have been given
one last night if her jealousy had carried her too far,
perhaps Zenobia. And perhaps the Leopardess left
so early because she had been given one.”</p>

<p>My brain seemed to resume its normal clearness
as the doctor spoke. There was really nothing very
extraordinary in the coincidence, if he was right.
After all, opium was the drug which it was natural
for anyone to use in such circumstances. It was
practically tasteless, its effects were easily mistaken
for those of alcohol even by the victim, till it was
too late for him to resist them. And the character
of the Domino Club was such, and its members came
to it in such secrecy, that one of them might be carried
home in a narcotic sleep, and die before wakening
from it, without his death ever being traced to the
place where he had been.</p>

<p>While these reflections were coming to compose
my mind Tarleton was renewing his investigation of
the dead man’s pockets. This time the result was
negative, so far as I could see. It gave a start to me
and to the Inspector when the doctor suddenly raised
himself with a look of triumph and exclaimed, “I
see it!”</p>

<p>Charles bent forward with a bewildered gaze. I
held my breath. The next sentence was decisive.</p>

<p>“There are no keys—not even a latchkey. Whoever
drugged him took his keys, and took them for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
purpose.” He turned on the startled Inspector, and
issued his commands like a general on a battlefield
ordering an advance all along the line. “Ring up
your people and find out if they have received a
report of any house being entered during the night or
early this morning. And ask them to send a man
round the theatrical costumiers to find out if any of
them have supplied costumes lately of a Zenobia and
a Salome and an Eastern one with a leopard skin.
Though I doubt if you will hear anything about the
last. It sounds like one made up privately. Meanwhile
we will ask Madame Bonnell to give us
some breakfast.”</p>

<p>Madame was charmed to give us breakfast. Gerard’s
report of his examination must have impressed
her favourably. It was clear by this time that the
great Sir Frank Tarleton could be trusted to conduct
the investigation with prudence, and not to bring any
unnecessary publicity on the Domino Club. She
beamed satisfaction when he informed her that he
hoped to learn Wilson’s address within the next few
minutes, and to have the body removed thither for
the inquest. In her absence he added to his instructions
to Charles:</p>

<p>“I think, Captain Charles that it will be well if
you can go yourself to the Foreign Office and ascertain
through them if this Crown Prince actually was
present last night. They will feel more confidence in
you than in one of the ordinary police.”</p>

<p>The Honourable Captain looked pleased. “Do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
you think it is possible that his life was aimed at,
after all, Sir Frank?” he added with deference.</p>

<p>Sir Frank shook his head. “That possibility is
disposed of by the abstraction of the keys. The solution
of the mystery lies there. But it is just possible
that the thief chose his occasion; that he relied on the
Prince’s presence to screen him from too close an
inquiry. At all events I find it difficult to accept too
many coincidences in the case.”</p>

<p>I thought I might venture to raise a different
point.</p>

<p>“Madame Bonnell had ample time to search the
body and remove anything she pleased before Captain
Charles came.”</p>

<p>My chief shook his head good-naturedly.</p>

<p>“I haven’t too high an opinion of Madame’s
ethical code, but I think sufficiently well of her intelligence
to feel pretty sure that if she had had any use
for her partner’s keys they would have been back in
his pocket before Captain Charles heard that he
was dead.”</p>

<p>The remark was unanswerable as far as I was
concerned. A moment later the expected message
came through from Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>The house of Doctor Weathered, of Warwick
Street, Cavendish Square, had been entered during
the night, and his safe had been found open, with his
bunch of keys in it. And the doctor himself was
missing.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

THE OPENED SAFE</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Inspector Charles</span>, I could see, was deeply impressed
by the sagacity with which Tarleton had
solved the riddle of the dead man’s identity. It was
a very simple step, but it is precisely the simple ideas
that generally escape the trained mind of the official.</p>

<p>“Doctor Weathered,” the Captain pronounced
slowly. “I suppose there is no doubt of that being
Wilson’s real name.”</p>

<p>“Very little doubt, I should say,” my chief responded.
“What do you think, Cassilis?”</p>

<p>I endeavoured to take a judicial tone.</p>

<p>“I don’t see much room for hesitation. Here is
a man without his keys, and there are the keys without
the man. Besides, it all corresponds with what
you said, Sir Frank, about the dead man’s appearance.
A fashionable West End physician is just
what I should expect him to be. And no one would
be in a better position to introduce people of good
position to a club of this kind.”</p>

<p>The Inspector’s face had become overcast with
doubt while I was speaking.</p>

<p>“That’s all very well,” he demurred, “but we
have been hearing a lot about Wilson’s being afraid
of enemies, and taking precautions about what he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
drank; and now it turns out to be a simple case of
burglary.”</p>

<p>Tarleton consulted me by a look. I just lifted
my shoulders in answer without speaking. Mine was
a difficult part to play just then. On the one hand, I
did not wish my chief to think me wanting in brains;
on the other, I dreaded above all things betraying any
previous knowledge of anything connected with
the mystery.</p>

<p>Fortunately he appeared to approve of my reserve.
“We may be able to understand that better when we
get to Warwick Street,” he said to Charles. “The
next thing for us to do is to go round there and send
some member of the household here to identify
the deceased.”</p>

<p>To this course there could be no opposition. The
plain-clothes man was called in and placed in charge
of the corpse with strict instructions to let no one
approach it unless he came with a written authority
from Sir Frank or the Inspector. Then the three
of us entered the doctor’s car and drove towards
Cavendish Square.</p>

<p>On the way my chief said to me, “It is curious
that I can’t call to mind ever having heard of a Dr.
Weathered. He must have been a man of high standing
in the profession, apparently; probably a consultant;
and yet his name is quite strange to me. Do
you happen to have heard it at any time?”</p>

<p>It was a difficult question for me. I dared not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
tell a lie which accident might expose at any moment;
but still less dared I tell the whole truth.</p>

<p>“I have heard the name,” I replied, speaking as
slowly as possible to give myself time to frame the
least compromising answer. “Perhaps I ought to
say that I heard it from one of his patients in the
course of a confidential communication, so that I
hardly know how far I am justified in making any use
of what I heard.”</p>

<p>Tarleton promptly raised his hand.</p>

<p>“Not another word,” he enjoined to my intense
relief. But my relief was qualified when he proceeded.
“A confidence made to a medical man is as
sacred in my view as a confession made to a priest.
You will understand that, Captain Charles, I am sure.
We must not ask Dr. Cassilis to tell us anything
more.”</p>

<p>Captain Charles assented rather reluctantly I
thought. His original disapproval of me seemed to
revive at the same time. He stole furtive glances at
me now and then, as though he were wondering
whether it was prudent on his part to keep such
doubtful company.</p>

<p>The gold repeater in Tarleton’s fingers kept time
to his meditations till the car drew up in front of a
smart house in a smart street in the region most
favoured by Court physicians and the big-wigs of the
medical profession, a class for whom I knew that my
eccentric chief felt a very moderate respect. The
house was brightly painted, and the windows were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
garnished with boxes of scarlet geraniums and blue
lobelias. The brass plate on the door was burnished
to shine like glass, and the steps were a dazzling
white. Nothing could have been further removed
from any suggestion of secret practices or unhallowed
consultations.</p>

<p>The man who opened the door to us matched the
exterior of the house as far as his own exterior was
concerned. He was young and clean-shaven, his
hair was beautifully brushed, and his neat clothes
were as new and well-fitting as those of the man
whom we had left lying in the alcove at the Domino
Club. The face itself was that of a simple, harmless
young man, incapable of suspecting either his master
or his master’s patients. It was impossible to think
that he had ever been aware of anything strange or
doubtful in his environment, so innocent and fresh
was his whole aspect. The very nervousness with
which he received us was the nervousness of youth
and inexperience finding itself in the presence of
unexpected trouble.</p>

<p>Inspector Charles briefly announced his name and
official character, and those of my chief, not deeming
me worthy of individual mention. Tarleton promptly
took the youthful butler in hand.</p>

<p>“Have the police been here before?” was his
first question.</p>

<p>Simmons, as he turned out to be named, said that
they had. The constable on the beat had noticed that
the front door was ajar about five o’clock that morning,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
and had promptly roused the household. He,
Simmons, had been first on the spot, and had begun
by supposing that his master had omitted to make
the door fast on his return. He knew that the doctor
had gone out overnight, though he had no idea
where. He went out pretty often, and was generally
rather late in coming home. However, the policeman
had insisted on his going to see if Dr. Weathered
was upstairs; and he had found his room empty and
the bed undisturbed.</p>

<p>On that, the officer had come in to search the
premises, beginning with the doctor’s consulting-room,
in which there was a safe. There the first
sight that met their eyes was the door of the safe
standing wide open. The key was in the keyhole,
with the whole bunch, including the latchkey, dangling
from it.</p>

<p>“And what had been taken from the safe?”
Tarleton asked, calling my attention with a significant
glance.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” was the surprising answer. “I mean
nothing as far as we could see. We opened the
drawers in which the doctor used to put his fees till
he paid them into the bank, and they were full, one
full of notes and the other of silver. The doctor’s
lowest fee was three guineas,” the doctor’s man added
with some pride.</p>

<p>“Take us to that room,” my chief commanded.</p>

<p>Simmons obeyed without hesitation. My heart
was beating so loudly in my ears that I could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
overcome the childish fear that it might be heard by
others, in spite of my medical knowledge to the contrary.
I fell back and let my companions go into
the room without me while I collected myself before
joining them.</p>

<p>Yet there was nothing in Dr. Weathered’s professional
sanctum to inspire dismay.</p>

<p>The room in which he received his patients was
as bright and as well appointed as everything else in
the establishment. A handsome walnut writing-table
was lightly strewn with medical books and papers,
relieved by a handsome china bowl full of roses.
The patient’s chair was luxuriously cushioned with
yellow silk, and the doctor’s own chair was a handsome
one upholstered in tooled morocco leather.
There was only one bookcase, and its appearance was
more suited to a drawing-room than a professional
man’s study. The frame was richly inlaid with ornamental
woods, and the glass doors were protected by
gilt wires. A small marble group of Eros and Psyche
stood on the top, flanked by Chinese dragons. Elsewhere
the walls of the room were hung with charming
water-colours, most of them of a rather sensuous
description, depicting youths and maidens bathing in
pools, and scenes of love and jealousy.</p>

<p>Tarleton took in every detail with one of those
swift, searching looks of his which seemed to penetrate
to some inner meaning beneath the surface of
all he saw. Finally, his eye rested on the corner in
which a safe about three feet high, painted to look<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
like oxydized silver, was clamped on a supporting
stand of ebony.</p>

<p>“You have locked the safe, I see. Where are
the keys?”</p>

<p>The sudden demand agitated the nervous butler.</p>

<p>“Miss Sarah has them,” he stuttered. “At least
she took them away when she locked up the safe.
Perhaps she’s given them to her mother—to Mrs.
Weathered.”</p>

<p>Sir Frank opened his eyes. I think we all did.
Somehow it seemed incongruous that the founder of
the Domino Club should be a married man.</p>

<p>“Is there a Mrs. Weathered then?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, sir.” Simmons showed as much surprise
as we had. “Would you like to see her, Sir
Frank?” He seemed rather eager to get away and
fetch his mistress to deal with us.</p>

<p>The consultant restrained him by an imperative
gesture.</p>

<p>“One moment, if you please. You haven’t told
us what happened after you had found the safe open.
Did you go to call Mrs. Weathered?”</p>

<p>“I should have gone, sir, but Miss Sarah came
down and found us looking into the safe. So I left
it to her.”</p>

<p>Again the man made a movement as if to escape,
and again the specialist arrested him.</p>

<p>“What brought her down? Did she know what
had happened?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>Simmons seemed honestly confused. “I really
can’t tell you, sir. I suppose one of the servants
must have gone upstairs and told her. They were
all about.”</p>

<p>Tarleton nodded. “Go on. When she came in
what did she do?”</p>

<p>“She was rather angry sir, at first. She thought
the doctor had come home in a great hurry to fetch
something for someone who was ill, and had rushed
off again, and forgotten to lock the safe and take his
keys. She said we had no business to look inside
in his absence. And she locked the safe herself, and
sent the policeman away, saying no doubt Dr. Weathered
would be back again presently. But that was
more than four hours ago, and there’s been no sign
of him yet, sir.”</p>

<p>It was evident that Simmons considered his young
mistress had been over-confident. We, who knew it
so much better than he did could only sympathize
with his feelings. Sir Frank made no further effort
to detain him.</p>

<p>“Very well. You can let Mrs. Weathered know
we are here, and say that I shall be glad to speak
with her as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>When the butler had gone he turned to me.</p>

<p>“What do you make of this room, Cassilis? What
sort of diseases do you think were treated here?”</p>

<p>I thought it best to glance at the pictures and the
marble group before expressing my opinion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>“Not very serious ones I should say,” I answered
lightly.</p>

<p>My chief frowned.</p>

<p>“And yet one of them has proved pretty serious
in its consequences,” he observed. “You don’t agree
with Miss Weathered that it was her father who left
that bunch of keys in the door of the open safe?”</p>

<p>I did my best to control myself as I shook my
head.</p>

<p>“Rather curious that she should have interfered,
though, instead of her mother,” Captain Charles put
in with an air of sagacity.</p>

<p>Tarleton threw himself into the doctor’s own
chair, and taking out his watch, began to swing
it gently.</p>

<p>“I expect to meet with more than one curious
circumstance in the course of this inquiry,” he said
lazily. “It is just possible that Weathered’s daughter
knew more about him than his wife did.” He sat
up suddenly. “But I am wasting your valuable time,
Captain Charles. There is nothing here that Cassilis
and I cannot deal with. It is simply a question of
having the body identified, and brought round here,
if the authorities decide to keep the case private.
You had better lose no time in communicating with
the Foreign Office and the Home Office, and letting
me know their decision. And don’t forget there are
the costumes to be traced.”</p>

<p>The Captain was already on the move. I fancied
he was not sorry to be released. Tarleton was too big<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
a personality for anyone else to find himself much
more than a dummy in his company, and the Inspector’s
sense of self-importance must have suffered as
long as he was in the physician’s train.</p>

<p>My chief was good enough to offer me a private
explanation as soon as we were alone.</p>

<p>“I have every confidence in Charles’s honesty,
but very little in his tact. And this is a case that
calls for very careful handling. These people won’t
tell us more than they can help if they are afraid
of a public scandal. And, on the other hand, if they
know that the whole affair is going to be hushed up
they won’t tell us anything at all.” Tarleton let his
eyes rove round the walls of the room as he proceeded.
“I don’t want Charles to see the direction in
which I am feeling my way. You see, he is not my
subordinate. He isn’t responsible to me for his
actions. He is quite at liberty to go to the Chief
Commissioner behind my back, and tell him whatever
is in his mind, and the Commissioner can go to
Sir James Ponsonby in the same way. We must
walk warily Cassilis.”</p>

<p>I tried in vain to catch the doctor’s eye while he
was speaking. How much did he mean to convey
by that singular warning? Was he referring to my
admission that I had heard Dr. Weathered’s name
before, and cautioning me to make no more such
admissions in the Inspector’s hearing? I felt a sick
apprehension which I dared not show.</p>

<p>Sir Frank seemed quite unconscious of my distress.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
“You and I,” he went on in a confidential
way, “know that it wasn’t Weathered who crept into
this room last night, and crept out again, leaving the
keys behind. And we also know that whoever came
here didn’t come for money. I think we can both
guess what he did come for—he or she.”</p>

<p>He darted a sudden glance at me as he uttered
the last word, and he must have seen me start. But
at that instant the door opened, and we both rose to
our feet to receive the ladies coming in.</p>

<p>There were two of them. Mrs. Weathered was
a woman of about the same age as the man whom
we had left lying in the Domino Club, but of a very
different social type. She was not vulgar in any
offensive sense of the word, but her appearance and
manner were those of a woman such as one would
expect to meet in the back parlour of a shop in a
provincial town, rather than in a West End drawing-room.
Her features were plain as well as homely;
her gray hair showed no trace of a skilful maid’s
art, and her fashionable dress only exposed her unfitness
to wear it. Such a wife could only be a serious
handicap to an ambitious man making his way upward
in London society. It was possible to at least
understand one of the doctor’s temptations to lead a
secret life which brought him into more congenial
company than his homely wife’s. Yet there was
something touching in her pale, worn face; and her
mild blue eyes searched our faces with a pitiful anxiety<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
that convinced me that her husband still had a
hold on her affection.</p>

<p>Her daughter was as little like her as it was possible
to be. Young enough in years—I put her down
as little more than twenty—her face and figure were
those of a ripe woman. Both were queenly. Her
sombre crown of hair and flashing eyes made me
think of Judith and the tragic heroines of old who
were driven to avenge themselves on the men who
had done them wrong. She betrayed none of her
mother’s anxiety. Stern, self-possessed and courageous,
she faced Sir Frank and myself with the
demeanour of the accuser rather than the accused.</p>

<p>Mrs. Weathered was the first to speak. Although
addressing my chief as the elder of us two, I found
her turning her eyes towards me as though more
hopeful of sympathy from my youth. Her daughter
on the contrary kept her intent gaze fixed on Tarleton
and seemed barely conscious of my presence in
the room.</p>

<p>“Have you any news for me, sir? Dr. Weathered
hasn’t come back yet—not since he was here in
the early morning, and left his keys behind.”</p>

<p>The physician shook his head with a grave air.</p>

<p>“I am not sure that you are right in thinking that
it was your husband who came here and left those
keys. Before I say anything more I should like to
look inside the safe.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Weathered turned a wondering look on her
daughter, who frowned in return.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>“Why?” She demanded. “Nothing has been
taken. I looked myself, and the money was all there
untouched. No burglar would have gone away without
helping himself to it, surely?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it was not a burglar. It was someone
who had been in your father’s company, or he could
not have obtained possession of his bunch of keys.”</p>

<p>The girl drew herself up in wrath.</p>

<p>“Dr. Weathered is not my father sir. My mother
has only been married to him five years. My name
is Neobard.”</p>

<p>A glimmering of the true situation came to me.
The dead man had married a widow, an unattractive
one, with a daughter old enough to resent her
mother’s action and show it. There could be no reasonable
doubt that she must have had money, probably
a good deal, and that her daughter’s fortune
had gone to enrich the step-father. I could pretty
well guess the whole story. A provincial doctor with
more brains than wealth had courted his rich patient
to obtain the means of coming to London and setting
up as a consultant in the West End. That was why
neither Tarleton nor I had heard of him as a man
distinguished in the profession. He had risen, not
by scientific merit, but by the possession of money
and an imposing manner. There were too many such
cases in the medical world.</p>

<p>By this time Mrs. Weathered had sat down and
invited us to do the same. But Miss Neobard remained
standing, still with the same air of suppressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
indignation. Tarleton appeared not to be
aware of anything strange in her manner.</p>

<p>“Your step-father, then,” he corrected himself
amiably. “Dr. Cassilis and I are better acquainted
with the usual contents of a doctor’s safe than you
are, I expect; and perhaps we shall be better able to
judge if anything has been taken than you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think he kept any drugs in it, if that’s
what you’re thinking of,” the girl said obstinately.
It was clear that she resented our being there and
was disposed to help us as little as possible.</p>

<p>“Indeed!” The specialist turned to Mrs. Weathered,
whose face showed some bewilderment at her
daughter’s attitude. “Perhaps you can tell me,
ma’am, if your husband specialized in any particular
disease, or class of diseases.”</p>

<p>The pale widow glanced at her daughter as though
for permission to answer, and was met by a smile
of scorn.</p>

<p>“I know that he takes nervous cases,” Mrs.
Weathered said with a certain hesitation. “He is a
psychological expert.”</p>

<p>She pronounced the phrase in the tone of a person
who had learnt it by heart, and expected us to
understand it better than she did herself. Miss Neobard’s
gall overflowed at the sound.</p>

<p>“He called himself that to begin with,” she put
in sharply. “Now it is a psychical analyst. Women
come and tell him their secrets as if he were a priest.”</p>

<p>A quiver in the eyelashes told me that this was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
the information my chief had been expecting to
receive. But his tone showed no animation when
he spoke.</p>

<p>“In that case I dare say Miss Neobard may be
right about the drugs. However, I must ask you to
be good enough to let me have Dr. Weathered’s
keys.”</p>

<p>The mother was evidently divided between fear
of us and fear of her daughter to whom she appealed
with another helpless look.</p>

<p>“By what right do you ask for them, Sir Frank?
My mother is not entitled to give up her husband’s
keys without his consent. He may be back at any
moment—and then you can ask him.”</p>

<p>At last it was necessary to speak out. The girl’s
position was perfectly right if she was ignorant of
her step-father’s fate.</p>

<p>“I am deeply sorry to be the bearer of bad news,”
Tarleton said to the widow. “I’m afraid you must
prepare yourself to hear the worst.” He paused for
a moment. The ready tears that began to stream
from the poor woman’s eyes showed that she had not
been altogether unprepared, and the swift flash of
silent exultation in her daughter’s told plainly who it
was that had prepared her. I was pleased to see her
throw a caressing arm round her mother’s neck before
she spoke again.</p>

<p>“You mean that Dr. Weathered is dead?”</p>

<p>“A body has been found on certain premises in
Chelsea which there is reason to fear is his. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
part of our business here to find someone to come
round and identify him.”</p>

<p>A moan from the widow drew her daughter’s
arm more tightly round her. She thrust her free
hand into a pocket and drew out a bunch of keys.</p>

<p>“Take these. And excuse me. I must take my
mother to her room. I will come back in a few minutes
and go round with you to the Club.”</p>

<p>I was quick to open the door as the strange girl
supported her mother out of the room. I had no
sooner closed it again than my chief repeated her
last words.</p>

<p>“The Club!—I fancy that young woman could
tell us a good deal about her step-father if she chose.
And now!”</p>

<p>He stepped towards the safe, found the right key,
and threw open the door.</p>

<p>“What do you say has been taken, Cassilis?”</p>

<p>There could be no doubt as to the answer, although
I went through the form of looking carefully
inside before I gave it.</p>

<p>It was the doctor’s case-book that was missing,
the book containing the secrets of the women.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

DR. WEATHERED’S PATIENTS</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My chief</span> made a swift search through the safe.
The cash drawers were empty, and he gave me a
significant nod.</p>

<p>“Miss Sarah has been through the safe since the
policeman left. A remarkable girl that, Cassilis!
How did she come to know of the Domino Club?”</p>

<p>I was as little able to answer the question as he
was. Still, I had formed a vague theory in my
own mind.</p>

<p>“She rather gave me the impression of hating her
step-father on her mother’s account,” I threw out.
“Mightn’t she have watched him on her mother’s
behalf?”</p>

<p>“That is a possible explanation, certainly,” my
chief was good enough to respond. “We are dealing
with one of those family tragedies which so seldom
come to light. The ambitious man has married
for money, as the girl has seen from the first, and
the woman won’t see. Then he has found his wife
in the way, and begun to neglect her. She, poor
thing, has tried to hide the situation from her child,
but Sarah has found it out for herself, and resented
it. She has tried to open her mother’s eyes, and
failed; or rather the mother has concealed the fact
that she is no longer blind. Then in desperation, perhaps,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
the girl has gone secretly to work to obtain
proof of her step-father’s infidelity, proof that will
leave her mother no excuse for keeping her eyes shut
any longer; that will compel her to leave the
man....”</p>

<p>The speech trailed off into a soliloquy, which
became a silent one. Suddenly he stood up grasping
in his hand a square glass bottle half full of pellets
like those we had found on the corpse.</p>

<p>“No need for further evidence of identity than
this!” he exclaimed in triumph. “But this must be
between you and me, Cassilis; I don’t think Charles
can have been altogether satisfied with the theory that
Weathered only carried these pellets to give to his
enemies and this discovery makes it still less probable.
He may have administered them for other
purposes.”</p>

<p>I shuddered at the hint. The Domino Club took
on a darker shade in my imagination and I scarcely
dared ask myself what horrors might have been concealed
by those embroidered curtains that screened
its Moorish alcoves.</p>

<p>Tarleton slipped the glass bottle into his coat
pocket, and locked the safe. Then he turned to survey
the doctor’s table.</p>

<p>“Now let us reconstruct the crime provisionally,”
he said. “A patient of Weathered finds that
he is in the doctor’s power and finds that Weathered
is disposed to take some base advantage of him. He
has seen the doctor recording his confession in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
book, and he determines to release himself by getting
hold of that book and destroying it. He is a member
of the Domino Club; most likely he has been tempted
or compelled to join it by Weathered. He may or
may not know of these pellets and the purpose for
which they are used. At all events he conceives the
plan of drugging Weathered, obtaining his keys, and
coming here to destroy the incriminating record. He
carries out his purpose successfully, so far. But in
his haste and excitement he overlooks one thing.
And it is here.”</p>

<p>For the life of me I could not repress a start as
the consultant brought his hand down sharply on a
small book that lay beside the inkstand on the writing-table.
Little need to say what it was! The
moment after Weathered’s appointment-book was
lying open, and my chief’s keen eyes were rapidly
searching the pages.</p>

<p>I ought not to have felt so intensely anxious as I
watched those bushy eyebrows knitting themselves
over a meagre list of names and dates. The dead
man’s patients had been numerous, and most of them
no doubt had come and gone without the least suspicion
of anything irregular in the doctor’s practice,
and without compromising themselves by any indiscrete
confidences. What evidence could such a book
afford against anyone? Still, I was uneasy. My instinct
warned me that Tarleton would find some
information that he needed in those pages. And my
observation told me presently that he had found it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>“Listen, Cassilis. Most of these appointments
seem to be perfectly innocent and normal. But there
are certain names occurring more than once that have
numbers attached to them. What do you make of
this?—Sir George Castleton, 17; he has been coming
once a fortnight. Mrs. Worboise, 21; about once
a month. Miss Julia Sebright, 8; she seems to have
dropped off. Colonel Gravelinas, 26; h’m. Mrs.
Baker, 35; rather more recent than the others. Lady
Violet Bredwardine—what is the matter?”</p>

<p>I jerked myself round towards the door of the
room. “I thought I heard someone outside.”</p>

<p>By a stroke of good luck someone was. The
door opened as I spoke, and Sarah Neobard appeared
with a hat on ready to go out.</p>

<p>Tarleton quietly closed the book and placed it in
his pocket under her eyes.</p>

<p>“I am taking Dr. Weathered’s appointment-book,
Miss Neobard. I shall have to make inquiries
about some of his patients.”</p>

<p>The stately Sarah’s eyes flashed vindictively.
“You are welcome to any information I can give you
about them, Sir Frank. One of them is at the bottom
of this crime, you may be sure.”</p>

<p>Tarleton lifted his eyebrows. “We don’t yet
know that it is a crime—in that sense,” he said with
an air of doubt. “Dr. Weathered seems to have been
drugged by someone who wanted to get his keys.
But whoever did it may not have meant to give a
fatal dose.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>I listened anxiously. I was puzzled to understand
the specialist’s theory. Did he consider that
Weathered had succumbed to a dose that would not
have killed a man in ordinary health? And if so,
was his death due to some organic weakness, as I had
myself suggested when we were viewing the corpse?
Or was it possible that Weathered was in the habit
of taking the pellets found upon him, after all, and
that he had just absorbed such a quantity of the
poison into his system that the extra dose proved
mortal in consequence? My experience was not
enough to enable me to form a decided opinion of my
own on either of these alternatives.</p>

<p>While these thoughts were passing through my
mind Miss Neobard was scrutinizing my companion’s
face with suspicion.</p>

<p>“You are not saying what you really think, Sir
Frank,” she pronounced boldly. “He has been murdered,
and you know it, but you are afraid of shocking
me by saying so outright. You needn’t mind.
I look on this as a judgment, and I have seen it
coming.”</p>

<p>The physician gazed at her as steadily as she was
gazing at him.</p>

<p>“Have you any objection to telling me why?”</p>

<p>“No. Now that my mother isn’t here I don’t
care what I tell you. Dr. Weathered never loved her,
but she loved him. She wouldn’t believe anything
bad of him while he was alive, and now he’s dead I
don’t want her to hear anything that would grieve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
her for nothing.” She seemed to consider for a
moment what to say next. “You mustn’t think he
was altogether wicked, at all events at first. He was
very clever, and he knew that he could do well in
London with my mother’s money. And he was really
interested in science. He had studied psychology for
years before he started as a nerve specialist. I believe
that he meant to practise quite respectably when he
began here. It was the women who led him astray.”</p>

<p>A singular statement to be made by the step-daughter
who had so much reason to hate him, and
who every now and then gave me the impression that
she had hated him.</p>

<p>“Half the women who came to consult him, I believe,
had nothing the matter with them except a
craving for excitement. He told us that himself,
though, of course, he didn’t say what kind of excitement
they craved for. He used to talk about his
practice at first, and tell us the names of some of his
patients, when they were big people. One was a
duchess, another was a famous author. But after a
time he stopped talking about them. That was when
he began to fall under their influence. They sent him
invitations to dinner without inviting my mother.
And he accepted them.”</p>

<p>One could see, as it were, the rift opening, and
this keen-eyed, strong-minded girl taking precocious
notice of everything and watching her step-father’s
downward progress.</p>

<p>“Then he took up with this psycho-analysis, pretending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
he could cure people of their troubles and
change their dispositions by encouraging them to talk
to him freely. I knew he didn’t really believe in it.
He had sneered at it often enough when it first came
up. He took to it simply because it was the way to
make money. I fancy the other doctors looked down
on him because of it. At all events they seemed to
boycott him. None of them ever came here, and
their wives left off calling on us. I soon saw there
was something wrong.</p>

<p>“I tried to get my mother to do something, but
she wouldn’t or couldn’t. She had no influence over
him apart from her money, and he was making so
much that he was independent of her. And she
wouldn’t leave him. She had no legal grounds, of
course. Whatever went on was carefully concealed
from her. He couldn’t have afforded an open rupture.
That would have frightened off his patients.”</p>

<p>Sarah paused for breath, and my chief and I
exchanged looks. It was a curious revelation, and
the strangest part of it was the manner in which it
was being made. The accuser seemed to be also the
defender. There was a very thoughtful wrinkle on
Tarleton’s brow, as though he was listening to more
than the words that reached his ear.</p>

<p>All this time there had been no reference to the
Domino Club. I think we were both rather eager
to learn something about that. But Miss Neobard
didn’t appear to need prompting. She came to the
subject of her own accord.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>“At last we almost ceased to see anything of him.
He went out night after night, and didn’t come home
till the early morning. He was a strong man, but his
health began to suffer, and I think he was taking to
drink latterly. At one time he kept nothing in the
house, but lately there was brandy in a cupboard, and
I have seen him going to it in the morning as soon
as he came down. This was after he had gone to
that abominable club.”</p>

<p>“The Domino Club?” my chief put in quietly.</p>

<p>“Yes, I dare say you wonder how I came to know
of it. Perhaps you think I oughtn’t to have taken
any notice of what was going on. It was my
mother’s business, really, but she was determined to
see nothing, and I had to protect her.”</p>

<p>The explanation was given with a touch of defiance.
Was it the true one? Was it solely zeal on her
mother’s behalf that had inspired the girl of nineteen
or twenty to play the part of a detective? Or had
other motives mingled with the avowed one? A
touch of feminine curiosity, perhaps? A subtle temptation
to look down into the gulf in which the man
was disappearing? Or else?...</p>

<p>She saw no need to tell us how she had obtained
her knowledge, apparently. I didn’t think her the
kind of girl to employ an agent. She was quite
capable, I felt sure, of searching her step-father’s
papers, or following him secretly. Her object, as
far as we were concerned, was evidently to inculpate
his patients even more than himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>“It was the women,” she repeated with bitterness,
“who dragged him into it. They wanted a
place in which they could have all the excitement of a
night club without the risk of meeting low-class
people. There was a Mrs. Worboise——” I glanced
at my chief as I recalled the No. 21 of the appointment-book,
but his lips were firmly compressed——“I
feel convinced that she provided some of the
money. But there were others, too, plenty of them.”</p>

<p>I was thankful that she stopped there without
mentioning more names. My chief also seemed to
think that she had said enough for the present.</p>

<p>“Very well, Miss Neobard. I am sure that you
have acted for the best in giving me this information,
and I’m very much obliged to you. Now suppose
we drive round to the Club for you to identify
the body.”</p>

<p>The sight of Evans, the doctor’s chauffeur, in
front dried up the girl’s flow of speech, and the drive
was a silent one. Arrived at Vincent Studios I
noticed that Tarleton stood back to let the young lady
go in front, and that she took her way without hesitation
towards the door bearing the name of Loftus,
A.R.A. The policeman we had left in charge opened
the door to us, and my chief again tested Miss Neobard’s
knowledge by waiting for her to precede us.
But this time the test failed.</p>

<p>“Where is the body?” she asked in a whisper,
coming to a stand in the narrow passage.</p>

<p>“This way.” Sir Frank gravely took the girl’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
arm in his own and led her straight to the spot.
Whether she quivered as they approached the alcove
I could not tell, but there was no mistaking her agitation
when she caught sight of the stiff form and
pallid face. A stifled cry escaped her lips. She
leaned forward impulsively, almost as if she had been
going to embrace the corpse, and then straightened
herself up with a shudder.</p>

<p>“How dreadful he looks!” she gasped.</p>

<p>There was some excuse for the exclamation, out
of place as it seemed at such a moment, and from
her lips. The leaden tinge that had struck my attention
earlier in the day had deepened and spread over
the face and neck, and had become noticeable in the
hands as well. The roughness was also accentuated,
giving the skin the look of crude parchment in need
of scraping before it could be written on. My experience
was not enough to tell me whether these were
unusual symptoms, and remembering the caution my
chief had given me, I was careful to make no remark
on them. I watched the great expert’s face, but I
might as well have watched the dead man’s for any
information it gave me. He had drawn out his
golden mascot, as it were unconsciously, and was
swinging it with more than usual deliberation as he
scanned the ghastly features with an air of the deepest
abstraction.</p>

<p>Sarah Neobard was less successful in hiding her
emotions. In spite of the constraint she was evidently
putting on herself I detected a tear edging its
way down her cheek. Perhaps her memories of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
dead were not all bitter ones. Perhaps there had
been a time when he had treated her with kindness.
Perhaps—but my speculations were cut short by a
self-assertive step behind us.</p>

<p>All three of us turned round to see Captain
Charles striding down the deserted room. By this
time the red lights had been put out. The daylight
reached everywhere, and gave the whole place an
inexpressibly dreary, discomforting look. The gauze
curtains showed bare and shabby, and the cushioned
divans and couches revealed wine and coffee stains.
The floor was dusty and discoloured. A comparison
occurred to me between the dismal scene of revelry
and the feelings of the revellers themselves as they
awoke next day with jaded nerves and scorched palates
and guilty recollections of their orgy.</p>

<p>Captain Charles was bursting with self-importance.</p>

<p>“I have just come from the Foreign Office,” he
began, when Sir Frank pulled him up rather peremptorily.</p>

<p>“Be good enough to wait a moment, Inspector.”
He turned to the distressed girl. “You identify this
as the body of your step-father, Dr. Weathered?”</p>

<p>She bowed faintly. “Yes—though it is fearfully
changed!”</p>

<p>“That is sufficient. Do you feel able to go back
by yourself, or would you rather have someone to
escort you?”</p>

<p>“I would rather be alone,” she murmured.</p>

<p>“Very well; then I need not keep you.” He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
looked away towards the outer door of the room, but
the girl stood hesitating.</p>

<p>“Will it—shall you—the body?” she inquired in
a broken voice.</p>

<p>“The body must be removed to my house first
for me to ascertain the cause of death,” Tarleton said
kindly. “After that I hope to arrange for it to be
buried from your house privately. Meanwhile, the
less you say to anyone the better.”</p>

<p>She bent her head gratefully, and I took her as
far as the door of the studios, and saw her walk
away. When I got back the Inspector was in the
full flood of his report.</p>

<p>“I have never seen the Foreign Office more
upset about anything,” he was saying. “And the
Slavonian Embassy is in a regular turmoil. It appears
that the Ambassador had no idea of where
His Royal Highness was last night. He slipped out
quietly without saying anything, with the Chancellor
of Legation, Baron Novara. Baron Novara is
a member of the Domino Club; he has always looked
on it as a perfectly reputable place, a fashionable
resort—in fact, like Hurlingham or the Prince’s
skating-rink; and he had no idea that he was risking
anything in bringing the Crown Prince here. At
least so he says. The Ambassador is furious and
has ordered him to go home by to-night’s express
and explain matters to the King, if he can.”</p>

<p>My chief listened to the excited Charles with a
good deal of indifference, I thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>“The sum and substance of it all is that they
want the affair hushed up, I suppose?”</p>

<p>I listened for the Inspector’s answer with an
eagerness which I did my very best to hide. I am
not sure that I did hide the relief with which I
heard it.</p>

<p>“It <i>must</i> be hushed up,” he cried with positive
indignation. “The Chancellor was fool enough to
put in the official circular to the Press of the Crown
Prince’s movements that he was present at a dance
at the Domino Club last night.”</p>

<p>“That will be good news for Madame Bonnell,”
the consultant observed dryly. “Is there any idea
at the Embassy that the Prince’s life was aimed at?”</p>

<p>Captain Charles glanced round cautiously and
lowered his voice.</p>

<p>“That’s the worst of it. The Bolsheviks are
working their hardest to upset the monarchy in Slavonia,
and it is believed that one of their agents in
this country obtained admission to the club last night
disguised as a woman.”</p>

<p>“Zenobia!” I could no more keep in the ejaculation
than I could still the beating of my heart as I
gave it vent.</p>

<p>My two companions turned sharply and looked
at me, the Inspector with a certain grudging respect,
my chief with a slight frown of something very like
disdain. I bit my tongue too late.</p>

<p>“Zenobia seems to have made a bad guess at the
Prince’s identity,” Tarleton said mercilessly. “Unless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
His Royal Highness wore an Inquisitor’s costume,
too?”</p>

<p>The Captain’s face fell as he responded to the
question.</p>

<p>“I didn’t inquire about that, Sir Frank,” he admitted.
“I’ll go round again and find out.”</p>

<p>“Do, please. It will be time enough to consider
Zenobia’s part in the mystery when we have heard
from the theatrical costumiers. One moment——”
Captain Charles had taken a step towards the exit—“I
should like you to wait till I have put a question
to Madame Bonnell.”</p>

<p>He touched the nearest bell-push as he spoke, and
the Inspector and I looked at each other with curiosity
as to his purpose. The bell was promptly answered
by Gerard, and within a few moments the
proprietress of the club sailed into the room.</p>

<p>She was decidedly more at ease than she had been
when we interviewed her first. Touches of mourning
had been added to her elegant dress, and her whole
manner had been toned down to that of a dignified
lady in distress. Tarleton appeared to meet this
assumption by an added roughness in addressing her.</p>

<p>“Will you be good enough to tell me the rules of
the Domino Club as to the admission of visitors?”</p>

<p>Madame Bonnell put her head on one side for a
moment, giving herself the air of a person who was
considering whether to grant a favour.</p>

<p>“I see no objection to that, Sir Frank. You are
Sir Frank Tarleton, are you not?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>The question was almost impudent. The physician
ignored it with a sharp “Well?”</p>

<p>“Every member was entitled to one card of admission
for a friend for each dance. He was required
to enter the name of the friend, and the
costume he was coming in, in the club register.”</p>

<p>“Let me see the register, please.”</p>

<p>Madame had evidently expected this demand.
She drew herself up.</p>

<p>“The register is confidential. It contains the
names of all the members. I keep it for my private
information, and I can’t show it to anyone else.”</p>

<p>Tarleton turned to the Police Inspector with a
shrug. “I must ask you to do your duty, after all,
I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>The Frenchwoman turned red with excitement.</p>

<p>“But what does this mean? Have you seen the
papers?” She produced an evening paper from her
dress, one of those evening papers that come out
early in the forenoon. “Here it is announced that
His Royal Highness the Crown Prince of Slavonia
honoured me by his presence here last night. My
club is under royal patronage, you see, gentlemen.
This is not an affair for the police.”</p>

<p>My chief had described Captain Charles as thorough.
He showed his quality as soon as the angry
woman had spoken. First setting a whistle to his
lips, he stepped forward and placed a firm hand on
her arm.</p>

<p>“I arrest you in the King’s name.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

THE BOOKS OF THE DOMINO CLUB</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It was</span> at once evident that Sir Frank Tarleton
had taken the measure of his opponent accurately.
As soon as she felt the police officer’s touch Madame
Bonnell’s confidence deserted her, and she collapsed
in a state of mingled panic and bewilderment.</p>

<p>“<i>Mon Dieu!</i> But what have I done? What is
it that I am accused of?” She looked imploringly
from Charles to Tarleton and from him to me.</p>

<p>It was the Inspector who answered.</p>

<p>“Obstructing the officers of the law in the course
of their duty is the charge at present. There may
be others later on. Meanwhile I have to caution you
that anything you say will be taken down and may
be used in evidence against you.”</p>

<p>Madame’s reception of the stereotyped warning
convinced me that this was the first occasion on which
she had come into collision with the English law.
It appeared to impress her favourably, and to dispel
her first terrors.</p>

<p>“But there is some mistake,” she protested. “I
did not understand. I have no wish to resist the
law. I thought there was an understanding that this
misfortune should not be dealt with by the police.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” my chief interjected roughly. “It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
is being dealt with by the police. They have been in
possession of these premises since five o’clock this
morning—since you called them in yourself. Do
you intend to produce the register, or must we
search for it?”</p>

<p>Madame Bonnell gave a last sigh of reluctance.
Then she was all submission. She led the way out
of the dancing-hall into the adjoining premises. Her
private apartment was between the kitchen and the
row of dressing-rooms for the accommodation of
the dancers who preferred to assume their costumes
on the spot. Drawn curtains on one side concealed
what was no doubt Madame’s bed; the rest of the
room having the aspect of a business man’s parlour,
furnished with a roll-top desk, a typing machine and
shelves for books and correspondence. In one corner
was a cupboard with a stout door which the
proprietress unlocked with a show of eagerness, and
threw open for our inspection.</p>

<p>The contents of the cupboard seemed innocent
enough. A private ledger, a file of accounts, a cash-box
into whose contents Tarleton forbore to pry,
and, more important for our purpose, two thin volumes
bound in black leather, one of which was
labelled “<i>Members</i>” and the other “<i>Visitors</i>.” It
would have been unchivalrous to speculate as to the
contents of certain little bottles and boxes on a lower
shelf which had a look of feminine elegance.</p>

<p>My chief pointed to the two black-bound volumes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>“Will you take charge of these books, Cassilis.
We can examine them at our leisure.”</p>

<p>The Frenchwoman uttered a faint groan as I
stretched out my hand to obey. I could have groaned
in sympathy with her. And yet I was not in any
fear on my own account. I had no reason to think
that my name would be found in the Visitors’-book.
I had been too careful for that. But there was
another name which I had only too much reason for
expecting to see in the other volume. And I cursed
the proprietress in my heart for not destroying the
dangerous record while it was in her power. She
had fancied herself secure, and had cared nothing
for the security of her patrons. What did it matter
to her who might be incriminated, as long as her
livelihood was not threatened? True, she had done
her best at the last moment to prevent the authorities
from gaining access to these books. But it was easy
to see her self-interest in that. Those records were
part of her stock-in-trade. They gave her a hold on
the members of the club, who might be disposed to
forsake it as soon as any hint of the tragedy got
abroad. In that case she had only to say to them,
“Leave the club, throw me over, and I take my
books to the newspaper offices, and sell them for what
they will fetch.”</p>

<p>Such was the situation, so far as I could see it.
Either the reputation of the Domino Club was to be
saved, and all was to go on as before; or it would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
be for Madame’s benefit that the scandal should be
as widespread as possible, and that every member and
visitor should pay heavily for having his or her name
kept out of it. In parting with these two volumes
she was parting with her most valuable weapons as
a blackmailer.</p>

<p>Whether any such considerations as these influenced
my chief, I could not tell. Outwardly he
seemed to have only one end in view—the tracing of
the crime to its perpetrator. As soon as I had possessed
myself of the two books he made a sign to
Captain Charles.</p>

<p>“It will be as well for you to lock this cupboard
and keep the key for the present. Unless there is
anything that Madame Bonnell particularly wishes
to remove first.”</p>

<p>Madame glanced longingly at the row of mysterious
little boxes and bottles, but she prudently
shook her head.</p>

<p>“<i>Merci, monsieur.</i> I will take nothing. I wish
to have no secrets from the police. I prefer to replace
my perfumes from the shop.”</p>

<p>Tarleton smiled with a grudging respect. This
was an adversary after his own heart, one who knew
every point in the game, and knew when to play for
safety. The Inspector locked the door and pocketed
the key with the same wooden precision with which
he would have taken the number of a taxi or arrested
the Crown Prince of Slavonia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>“Is Madame Bonnell still under arrest?” he
inquired stolidly.</p>

<p>“Not as far as I am concerned,” the physician
said lightly. “My business with Madame is over.
All I have to do now is to make the medical examination,
and to wait for the result of your inquiries
elsewhere.”</p>

<p>A significant nod conveyed to the Inspector that
there was no occasion to let the Frenchwoman know
of the search that had been set on foot among the
costumiers. It was not unlikely that the proprietress
of the club could have thrown some light on the
identity of Salome and the mysterious Leopardess,
and could have told us whether the Crown Prince
had masqueraded as Zenobia, if she had chosen.
But it was a good deal more likely that any question
put to her on the subject would result in the parties
being privately warned.</p>

<p>Inspector Charles formally released his prisoner
who affected to take the step as a matter of course.
I had remarked, however, a light of intense gratification
in her black eyes when Sir Frank announced
that he had dismissed her from the case. She impressed
me as the sort of woman who could never
breathe quite easily in the near neighbourhood of
the police.</p>

<p>The arrangements for the removal of the body
were soon made. A covered police-van was requisitioned
to convey it to the retired house in Montague
Street, and the consultant and I drove on in advance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
taking the black-covered volumes with us. He talked
to me quite cheerfully on the way.</p>

<p>“An interesting woman, that. Her mind would
be a curious study for a psychologist—a real one, I
mean, not a charlatan like this wretched Weathered.
The words right and wrong have no meaning at all
for her, I should say. She must find it difficult to
understand our point of view. In her opinion, I
expect, the only thing that matters is that the name
of the Crown Prince should be kept clear of scandal.
If he has chosen to commit a murder, all that is necessary
is that the King of Slavonia should send me the
Order of Saint Somebody or other, and of course
the investigation will be dropped.”</p>

<p>We reached the house in good time for lunch,
and my kindly chief pressed me to make a good meal.</p>

<p>“You are looking fagged,” he observed. “If
you weren’t a teetotaller I should prescribe a half-bottle
of Burgundy. Our work is only beginning.
As soon as lunch is over I am going through the
Members’-book, comparing the names in it with
those in Weathered’s appointment-book. In that way
we may get a key to the mysterious numbers.”</p>

<p>I did my best to conceal the apprehension with
which I heard of this intention. I could see the
search narrowing by degree, and gradually isolating
a few names among which I had too much reason
to fear that one would be found which I would have
given all I possessed to exclude. I made an effort to
brighten up and eat the good things before me. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
doctor knew how to make the best of life, and an excellent
digestion enabled him to enjoy the lobster
mayonnaise and the tender cutlets provided by his
accomplished cook. He drank nothing stronger than
claret, but it was such claret as is not often found in
private cellars, and its perfume reached my nostrils
across the table like the breath of roses.</p>

<p>As soon as I thought he was sufficiently warmed
and cheered to relax a little I ventured to put the
question that had been trembling on my lips for
hours.</p>

<p>“Is it too soon to ask if you have formed any
opinion as to the cause of death, Sir Frank?”</p>

<p>He looked at me rather sharply, and his bushy
eyebrows drew together.</p>

<p>“I can form no opinion till I have made an
autopsy. If you mean have I made any conjecture,
I have made several, any one of which may be right
or may be wrong. Up to a certain point I am inclined
to agree with your theory.”</p>

<p>“With my theory!” I was surprised into repeating.</p>

<p>“Yes. If you recollect, you suggested that whoever
administered opium to Weathered had no intention
of causing death. The object seems to have
been to send him off into a state of unconsciousness
so as to obtain possession of his keys; and we know
what the keys were wanted for.”</p>

<p>“To suppress the evidence against some patient,
you mean?” I faltered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>“That is one view. Another possible view is
that the person who stole the case-book wanted to
obtain evidence for his own purposes. He may
have wanted to put pressure on some patient—or
patients.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” The protest escaped from me almost
unawares. A slight lifting of Tarleton’s brows
caused me to qualify it the next moment. “I mean
that wasn’t my theory.” I pulled myself together as
I went on. “Putting together everything we learnt
from Madame Bonnell and from the waiter and from
Miss Neobard, I suspect that Weathered had become
a thorough scoundrel. My view is that he was taking
advantage of the confessions made to him as a
medical man to blackmail his patients, and that one
of them was driven to desperation. She thought she
could deliver herself by obtaining access to his safe,
and destroying the documents. But she never
dreamed that she was giving him a fatal dose.”</p>

<p>“I needn’t tell you that would be no defence in
the eye of the law if it actually was fatal,” the specialist
put in grimly. “So you think it was the
work of a woman, do you?”</p>

<p>“The evidence, Gerard’s evidence, is to that
effect, surely? He described three women in connection
with the masked Inquisitor—not one man.”</p>

<p>“He described one woman as being rather like
a man. He suspected Zenobia of being His Royal
Highness.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>I hardly knew what to say. If there were any
chance of the waiter’s theory being adopted by my
chief, the relief to me would be as great as to Madame
Bonnell herself. But dare I hope anything of the
kind? The situation was so critical that I feared to
commit myself one way or the other. I fell back
on the other point in doubt.</p>

<p>“Do you consider it possible, sir, that an otherwise
harmless dose of morphia might prove fatal if
the person to whom it was given had already saturated
his system with opium?”</p>

<p>Again the specialist’s voice had a note of surprise.</p>

<p>“I should have thought your own knowledge
was amply sufficient to answer that question, Cassilis.
In ordinary circumstances, no; quite the contrary,
the dose would fail even to produce the effect
intended; it would hardly render the victim insensible.
But suppose that he had just taken his maximum
dose, and the extra quantity was administered
immediately after, then the effect might be very
serious, indeed.”</p>

<p>Somehow I felt that I was being fenced with.
Tarleton must have perceived a lack of candour on
my part in discussing the problem, and decided to
withhold his confidence for the time being. I had
to remind myself of the admissions I had been driven
to make in the course of the morning. My chief
knew that I had been a visitor to the Domino Club
on one occasion. He knew that I had heard something
of Dr. Weathered, and heard it in confidence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
as he supposed, or affected to believe, from a patient
of my own. He must have put two and two together
by this time. Some inkling of the truth must be in
his mind. It did not call for very much acuteness
on his part to see in me the confidential adviser of
one of Weathered’s patients—perhaps one of his
victims—possibly of the very one who had administered
the fatal dose, and carried off the incriminating
book.</p>

<p>I resolved to hold my tongue for the future.
I would make no more attempts to sound Sir Frank,
and would trust to his respect for professional secrecy
to protect me from any awkward questions from
him. The resolution was easier to take than to keep.</p>

<p>As soon as lunch was over the consultant led the
way upstairs to his study. It appeared that the autopsy
was to be postponed; the first business was to
be the examination of the books that Madame Bonnell
had been so unwilling to give up.</p>

<p>The physician seated himself at his massive bureau,
a combination of desk and cabinet, and drew
the volume labelled “<i>Members</i>” in front of him,
while I placed myself respectfully on a chair at the
side.</p>

<p>“The list of members isn’t a very large one,”
was his first observation. “One could hardly expect
it to be. The Domino Club has more the character
of a secret society than a club; a society for the pursuit
of illicit pleasures, let us say. Whom have we
here?” He opened the book as he spoke, and ran<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
his eye slowly down the first page. “The Duke of
Altringham—I am not surprised at seeing his name;
General Sir Francis Uppingham, K.C.B.; the Countess
of Eardisley; Honourable Janet Wilbraham;
Mrs. Worboise; Sir George Castleton, Bart.—h’m,
we are beginning to come across some of the names
in the appointment-book, but I don’t see anything to
account for the numbers attached to them. And I
shall be very much surprised if those numbers don’t
contain the true key to the mystery.”</p>

<p>He paused in reflection, and took Weathered’s
diary from his pocket. “The first thing, it seems
to me, is to make out a list of the members who were
also patients, and to underline the names of those
who had a number as well. It is among them that we
may expect to find Zenobia and Salome and possibly
the Leopardess as well, though her behaviour suggests
that she can hardly have been a patient. She
may have been one formerly.”</p>

<p>I listened anxiously. Every moment I was
expecting the name which I foresaw too surely would
be found in the final list of suspects. Suddenly Tarleton
turned to me with an unexpected order.</p>

<p>“While I am comparing these two books you can
go through the Visitors’-book It may interest you
to find the entry of your own name.”</p>

<p>I could not tell whether my dismay was visible
to the gray eyes that seemed to look at me with such
perfect indifference. My dilemma was truly critical.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
I knew, of course, that my name did not appear in
the volume I was required to search. And if I pretended
to look for it I should land myself in a series
of traps. My chief would want some explanation of
its absence; and what explanation could I give? If I
said that I had been present under a false name he
would naturally expect me to tell him that name.
And he would expect me to tell him at once, before I
opened the book and began the mock search. I had
barely a second in which to make up my mind. If
only my own reputation, or even my own life, had
been at stake, I think I should have thrown myself
on his mercy, and come out with the whole truth.
But I was held as in an iron vice. The knowledge
that the police were actively engaged in tracing the
purchasers of the costumes which had been described
to us by Gerard haunted my consciousness. I was
driven in despair to tell my first direct falsehood to
my chief.</p>

<p>I opened the volume hurriedly as I spoke.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I shall find my own name here.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” The question came instantly,
though it came in a quiet, friendly tone.</p>

<p>“My recollection is that I gave some other name.
I am trying to remember what. I was rather doubtful
about the character of the place, and didn’t want
to run the risk of it being known that I had been
there. I considered the name didn’t matter; I
thought it was merely a form.” I was glancing feverishly
through the pages as I talked, trying to pick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
out some name too common to be easily identified.
“Ah, yes, I remember now—Carter.”</p>

<p>I placed my finger on an entry nine months old.
A Mr. Robert Carter had been introduced on that
date by a Captain Smethwick.</p>

<p>Much to my relief Tarleton accepted the explanation
readily.</p>

<p>“I dare say a good many of the names in that
book are equally fictitious,” he said with good humour.
“Look and see what name the Crown Prince
took last night.”</p>

<p>It was easily found. A Count Donau had been
introduced by the Chancellor of the Slavonian
Embassy.</p>

<p>“Any other visitors?” the consultant asked
lightly.</p>

<p>I read aloud one or two masculine names, but
he pulled me up.</p>

<p>“Any ladies?”</p>

<p>There were two lady visitors. I read out both
their names without misgiving. One was a Lady
Greatorex, the other a Mrs. Antrobus, both of them
assumed names for aught I knew.</p>

<p>The specialist paid little attention for the moment.
He was busy with his duplicate list. I
watched him with increasing anxiety as he ticked off
name after name. At the end of half an hour he had
completed his task for the time being.</p>

<p>“I have here thirty-eight names of people who
were both patients of Weathered and members of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
Domino Club. And all of them, without exception,
were patients first. It is clear that he started the
club for their benefit, at once to keep them under his
influence, and to confirm them in the very inclinations
he pretended to relieve them from. The man was
a moral monster. If ever Satan had an active instrument
on earth this Weathered was the man. And I
doubt if the law could have touched him.”</p>

<p>His words almost invited me to say, “In that
case the law can very well afford to shut its eyes to
his fate.”</p>

<p>The adviser of the Home Office shook his head.
“That depends. The law must first know what
was his fate. It looks to me as though we were
as far off from knowing that as ever. We know
neither how he died, nor at whose hands, nor the
motive of the assassin at present.”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t everything point to his death being
more or less an accident?” I ventured to plead.</p>

<p>“On the contrary, I should say that everything
points to its being a deliberate and deeply-planned
murder.”</p>

<p>I gave a horrified gasp. Before I could collect
myself sufficiently to take in this formidable judgment
I was saved from exposing myself by the
familiar sound of the telephone bell.</p>

<p>In our hasty departure from the house that
morning I had neglected to disconnect the receiver
in my bedroom, and connect the one downstairs. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
sprang out of the room and upstairs, thankful for
the interruption. I was destined to receive a second
shock, though a less unnerving one. The call again
came from Inspector Charles, who had just received
a report from one of his subordinates engaged on
the case.</p>

<p>The costumier who had supplied the dress of
Salome had just been found. The costume had been
delivered two days before to Miss Sarah Neobard,
Warwick Street, Cavendish Square.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

THE CAUSE OF DEATH</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I waited</span> with sickening apprehension for a few
instants.</p>

<p>“And the others?—the Zenobia costume, has
that been traced?” I was driven to ask.</p>

<p>“Not yet. There are several more places to be
visited.”</p>

<p>The respite gave me time to breathe. As I slowly
descended the stairs, my mind became absorbed in
pondering the news I had just received, and the use
to which it might be put.</p>

<p>The figure of Salome came before me as I
had seen her the night before, pursuing the hooded
Inquisitor, luring him to dance with her, and keeping
a jealous eye on his movements when he was engaged
with other partners. Astounded as I was to learn
that the mysterious dancer was no other than the
dead man’s step-daughter, it did not take me long to
reconcile the intelligence with her remarkable character,
as revealed in the course of the morning’s
investigations.</p>

<p>I began to see depths in the strange girl’s nature
of which she herself had hardly been aware. It was
not only indignation on her mother’s behalf that had
prompted her to trace her step-father’s doings. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
was not merely curiosity that had brought her to the
Domino Club to watch his movements. Her fierce
denunciation of the women patients whom she had
accused of depraving him had been inspired by a
secret feeling of which she was herself unconscious.
The man had fascinated her unawares. Without
knowing it she had been jealous on her own account
as well as her mother’s. In a strange ignorance of
her own feelings which was yet a natural result of
the relationship in which she had been brought up,
she had continued to believe herself his enemy. She
had imagined that hatred was the passion that inspired
her to disguise herself and come to watch him,
to dance with him time after time, and to pursue him
with restless vigilance when he transferred his attentions
to anyone else.</p>

<p>Meanwhile it seemed to me that this discovery
offered me a chance of diverting inquiry from myself
and from one in whom I was far more deeply interested
than in Sarah Neobard. I must try to concentrate
Sir Frank Tarleton’s suspicions on Salome, and
induce him to pass over the other characters to whom
his attention had been drawn by the evidence of the
waiter Gerard and the entries in the books.</p>

<p>I entered his study again to find him engaged in
drawing up a list of names. I let my eye steal towards
the paper as I approached and my heart sank as I
read the one just written—“<i>Lady Violet Bredwardine</i>.”</p>

<p>“The mystery is solved, apparently,” I announced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
in a tone of confidence. “The Salome costume has
been traced to Miss Neobard.”</p>

<p>To my discomfiture the consultant merely gave
the nod of one who hears what he expected.</p>

<p>“Poor girl; I was afraid of it.”</p>

<p>He went on writing without further remark,
while I dropped into a chair and looked on with
sickly apprehension. At last he looked up.</p>

<p>“Listen, Cassilis. I have made a complete list
of the names which appear in the members’ roll and
also in the appointment-book with numbers attached
to them. We have still to find out what the numbers
mean, of course. Have you formed any theory on
that point?”</p>

<p>I shook my head. I was honestly ignorant, and if
I had been able to make any guess I should have
refrained, for fear of leading Tarleton in the very
direction I was anxious to turn him away from.</p>

<p>“All I can conjecture at this stage is that the
numbers refer to pages in the book that has been
abstracted from the safe,” the physician said
thoughtfully. “But I confess that that explanation
doesn’t satisfy myself. My instinct tells me that
these names are the names of persons with whom
Weathered had some peculiar relation, perhaps financial,
perhaps....” He paused and shook his head.
“At all events, if Madame Bonnell told us the truth
in saying that he went in mortal fear of some of his
fellow-members, I am convinced that the names of
those whom he feared are in this list.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>He passed it over to me. Of the dozen names it
contained more than half were those of women.
But I had no eyes for more names than one. I was
racking my brain for some convincing argument
against the course which my chief was evidently bent
on following.</p>

<p>“Miss Neobard’s name is not in this list,” I
objected. “And yet we know now that she was
present last night, and passed more time in Weathered’s
company than anyone else. And she had
very strong motives for regarding him with hatred.”</p>

<p>Again Tarleton exhibited signs of surprise, almost
of impatience.</p>

<p>“It seems to me, Cassilis, that you have a good
deal to learn in the analysis of human nature, or at
all events of feminine nature, if you consider that
hatred was the motive that inspired that young
woman to follow her step-father to the Domino Club
last night. Hatred of the other women who were
there, if you like, but certainly not hatred of him.”</p>

<p>It was difficult for me to keep up the pretence
of believing in a theory which my own judgment
had already discarded. I fell back on another point.</p>

<p>“What strikes me, sir, that all the persons whose
names appear in your list were old frequenters of
the club. They had had many previous opportunities
of drugging Weathered. Last night was the first
occasion on which his step-daughter was present, and
last night was the first time he was attacked.”</p>

<p>Tarleton accepted this argument more amicably.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>“Now you have made a real point. It might
be a good point if there were no other suspicious
features in the case. But it is open to this objection
that your argument cuts both ways. Sarah Neobard
lived in her step-father’s house, and had every opportunity
of administering drugs to him there. Why
should she have chosen the Domino Club for such
a purpose? And if her object was to obtain his keys,
she might have managed that when he was asleep
at home far more easily than anywhere else. That’s
the one point we mustn’t lose sight of in this affair—that
the motive was to gain access to Weathered’s
safe. Revenge was a secondary consideration.”</p>

<p>I felt myself fairly cornered. Prudence compelled
me to assent to my chief’s reasoning.</p>

<p>“I will ask you to make a copy of this final list
and send it round to Captain Charles,” he went on
to say. “The police may be able to find out something
about these twelve persons which will narrow
the inquiry down to one or two.”</p>

<p>I held out a hand that almost trembled for the
paper, and hastened to fold it up and slip it into my
pocket. The thought had instantly occurred to me
that I might omit one name in the copy to be sent
to the police without much risk. If the omission were
discovered it would be put down to carelessness, and
meanwhile time would have been gained.</p>

<p>Tarleton had risen to his feet.</p>

<p>“And now it is time to examine the body,” he
said gravely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>I followed him out of the room and into the
laboratory, where the corpse lay stretched on a marble
slab, ready for the surgical knife. The sight
distracted me for a time from my other anxiety. I
was profoundly puzzled by the symptoms I have
described already. The grayness I had remarked
had grown deeper, and the whole surface of the skin
was corrugated by tiny wrinkles, so that it presented
the appearance of a mummy dried by the embalmer.
It was impossible to attribute these signs to the action
of opium in any quantity of which I had experimental
knowledge. My heart sank as I remembered the
ominous pronouncement of my chief. If he were
right, and another drug, more deadly than opium,
had been administered by an unknown hand to the
masked Inquisitor during last night’s revel, the situation
would be terrible indeed. The murder, the
deeply-planned murder, as Sir Frank had termed it
in advance, would be attributed to the same hand
that had abstracted the keys and carried off the case-book
from the safe.</p>

<p>The proceedings in which I had now to play the
part of assistant were of too gruesome a nature to
be described in anything but a medical report. It
is enough to say that the general result was negative
as far as my medical knowledge went. There was
no sign of any organic injury. There was nothing
in the condition of the heart to explain the fatal
event. The internal symptoms corresponded closely
with the external ones. Everything pointed to death<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
having been brought about by the action of a poison
similar in some of its effects to opium, yet having
a peculiar influence on the interior membranes as
well as on the outer cuticle. But what that poison
was I was at a loss to tell.</p>

<p>The specialist seemed to be as completely baffled
as myself. He pursued the examination almost in
silence, only speaking from time to time to ask me
to hand him the different reagents used in testing for
poisons. It was quickly evident that none of the
common poisons was present. Anything like strychnine
or arsenic was out of the question from the first.
The rapidity with which death had taken place eliminated
the possibility of germs. More subtle agents,
such as belladonna and aconite, were tested for in
vain. In the midst of my overpowering anxiety I
was moved to admiration by the expert’s extraordinary
skill. All kinds of tests of which I had never
heard were brought to bear; drugs unknown to me
even by name were called into requisition; minute
discolorations were examined by a powerful microscope;
a galvanic battery was applied to one organ,
and the X-ray to another. And still there was no
positive result.</p>

<p>Hours passed away unnoticed in the laborious
search. It was nearly dinner-time when Tarleton
at length straightened himself up with a look of
finality, walked across the room, and began washing
his hands.</p>

<p>“I have now tried for every agent known to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
British Pharmacopœia that might possibly have produced
death with such symptoms as those, and not
one is present,” he said with extreme gravity.</p>

<p>I felt myself shivering. If anyone else had been
speaking I should have thought he was attributing
the death to a supernatural cause.</p>

<p>“There are only two possibilities left, so far as
I can see,” he continued. “One is that I am dealing
with a murderer whose knowledge of poisons is more
extensive than my own.”</p>

<p>I shook my head in protest.</p>

<p>“In that case,” Tarleton went on deliberately,
“he must be a foreigner. And we must be prepared
to find that the life of the Crown Prince was aimed
at, after all. The Bolsheviks are in close relation
with a party among the Chinese. It may well be
that the Chinese possess the secret of treating opium
in such a way as to make it produce effects unknown
to Western science. I shall have to ask Charles to
find out what costume the Prince wore last night, and
to learn a little more about the Chancellor of the
Slavonian Legation.”</p>

<p>He broke off for a few moments, and I breathed
more freely than I had done for many hours. He
finished drying his hands before he spoke again.</p>

<p>“There is a second possibility. There is one
drug known to me which does in fact produce appearances
exactly like those we have seen. But it
is a drug not mentioned in the Pharmacopœia, and
I had every reason to believe that I was the only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
person in this part of the world who had any of it in
his possession. I keep it in a sealed bottle in my
private safe, and I am now going to see if that
bottle has been tampered with, and any of the poison
is missing.”</p>

<p>The consultant was facing me as he spoke, and
his keen gray eyes were fixed on me with an expression
which might have been merely meant to impress
me with the gravity of the situation. But my conscience
took the alarm. For the first time a sickening
conviction seized me that I was being watched.
I told myself that my chief had noticed signs of
confusion and dread in my behaviour, and had begun
to entertain a suspicion that I knew more about the
tragedy than I had chosen to reveal.</p>

<p>Now it seemed his suspicion had gone deeper.
He was actually asking himself if I had taken advantage
of my opportunities as an inmate of his house
to search for a more subtle drug than morphia, and
had stooped to rob him. And although I knew
myself to be innocent of any such action, I trembled
at the idea. If the bottle or any of its contents
should be missing, how could I possibly hope to
exculpate myself?</p>

<p>I dared not to open my lips. Tarleton, with
something like a sigh, went towards the cabinet in
which his drugs were stored, took out his bunch of
keys and applied one of them to a small steel safe
on an inner shelf. I held my breath as the door
swung open. He put in his hand, took out a square<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
glass bottle of the size known to chemists as four-ounce,
and held it up to the light.</p>

<p>The bottle appeared to be full of a gray powder.
The glass stopper was covered with black
sealing-wax, and he bent his head over it, minutely
scrutinizing the edges of the wax, and the impression
of a seal on the flat top.</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven!”</p>

<p>I echoed the ejaculation in my thoughts as he
raised his head and looked round at me with a smile
of unmistakable relief.</p>

<p>“It is exactly as I left it I sealed it with my
own signet ring.” He extended his little finger for
me to see. “The seal is intact. If this was the
poison used, it wasn’t obtained here.”</p>

<p>I had reason to feel satisfied. I knew my chief’s
generous nature well enough to feel sure that he
would feel remorse for his momentary suspicion of
me, and would be disposed to atone for it by shutting
his eyes to whatever else might point to my
being concerned in the case. In fact he now proceeded
to give me a short holiday.</p>

<p>“I shan’t want you for the rest of the day, Cassilis,
if you want to go out. I think we have done all
we can till we hear further from the police. I am
now going to think quietly over the problem as
it stands.”</p>

<p>I was thankful to be released. I had certain
pressing business to attend to. But first of all I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
went to my own room and made a copy of the list
of names I had been charged to send to Inspector
Charles. And although the paper entrusted to me
contained twelve names, the one which I posted to
Scotland Yard only contained eleven.</p>

<p>My own business took me to a little street within
a stone’s throw of Piccadilly Circus in which I had
rented a room ever since I had taken up my abode
with Sir Frank Tarleton. It was my private retreat
in which I kept up a few friendships that I did not
want my chief to know of; an asylum in which I
could resume my independence for a few hours when
I was tired of the regular life I was compelled to
lead under my senior’s eye. I had taken the room
under my Christian name of Bertrand for greater
security. It was from this room that I had gone in
disguise to the Domino Club, and it was here that I
had dropped my disguise again, little dreaming that
before twelve hours had passed it would have become
a precious possession.</p>

<p>Luckily I had taken the precaution to leave it under
lock and key in an old suit-case that I kept under
the bed. As soon as I had let myself into the room
and fastened the door securely, I dragged out the
case and opened it with feverish haste. So far all
was well. The costume lay exactly as I had left it.
And now what was to be done with it?</p>

<p>I thought out the problem carefully. I followed
out in imagination the search of the police among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
the theatrical costumiers. At any moment they
might come to a certain little Jew in Wardour Street,
and force him to disclose the name and address to
which this very costume had been sent more than a
year ago. And the next step would surely be for
them to inquire what had become of it.</p>

<p>I thought then, and I think now, that I took
the most prudent course in the circumstances. I
first wrote a letter. Then I locked up the case again,
labelled it, and carried it up Shaftesbury Avenue to
the post office.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

THE LEOPARD’S CLAWS</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Inspector Charles</span> presented himself at the
house in Montague Street while Sir Frank and I
were at breakfast the next morning. My chief ordered
him to be shown in to us.</p>

<p>The Inspector’s manner struck me as rather
more reserved than it had been yesterday. It very
quickly appeared that he was acting under instructions
not received from the medical adviser of the
Home Office.</p>

<p>“The Chief Commissioner is anxious to know
if you have any report to make as to the cause of
death in this Domino Club affair,” he began by saying,
as soon as he had sat down.</p>

<p>Tarleton frowned slightly. Then he laid down
his knife and fork and faced the Inspector.</p>

<p>“I don’t expect to complete my report for some
time yet. I have certain inquiries to make which may
take anything from a few days to several months.”</p>

<p>Captain Charles looked astonished, as he well
might.</p>

<p>“Then it isn’t a simple case of opium-poisoning?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t a simple case, certainly. I don’t say
that opium was not administered. By the way, I
should be glad if you could find out for me what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
disguise the Crown Prince was wearing when he
went to the Club.”</p>

<p>The Captain drew himself up.</p>

<p>“I ascertained that yesterday. He wore a plain
black domino with a hood.”</p>

<p>“Ah! Rather like Weathered’s costume, then?”</p>

<p>I could have answered that question better than
Charles, I thought. There had been more than one
black domino worn at the fatal dance, but none that
had any real semblance to Weathered’s remarkable
costume. The pointed peak with the two eye-slits
in the cloth instead of a mask had plainly distinguished
the founder of the Club from everyone else
present. Of course I dared not offer my testimony
as a witness. I did not think it prudent even to make
a remark. Tarleton might have an object in putting
forward this particular view.</p>

<p>It quickly appeared what his object was.</p>

<p>“I don’t think the Commissioner is much inclined
to follow up that clue,” Captain Charles said
coldly. “They seem to think in the Foreign Office
that it would do harm to let any idea get abroad that
the Crown Prince was aimed at. It would look as
if London wasn’t a safe place for foreign royalties
to visit.”</p>

<p>The physician shrugged his shoulders impatiently.</p>

<p>“That has nothing to do with me, Captain
Charles. It will be time enough for the Foreign
Office to make their view prevail when we have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
something definite to go upon. At present I am
dealing with the cause of death. I want the police,
if they can, to find out if the Bolshevik authorities
have ever resorted to poison, and if so, what poison
they use. I imagine they have no restrictions on
opium, and I should be particularly glad to get hold
of samples of the opium that is coming into Russia
from China just now.”</p>

<p>The Inspector pulled a long face.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell the Commissioner what you say, Sir
Frank, of course. But I’m afraid he won’t much
like the idea of the inquiry being dragged out. His
theory is that death was accidental, the only object
being to get hold of the keys of the safe. And if
there isn’t going to be any public prosecution, he
wants to close the Club as soon as possible, and send
the woman Bonnell out of the country.”</p>

<p>For once I saw Tarleton really angry.</p>

<p>“I trust Sir Hercules will recognize that it is
for me to decide whether the death was accidental,
and that he will take no such steps until he has received
my report through the Home Office. Unless
you can undertake that he will hold his hand for
the present I must communicate with Sir James
Ponsonby at once.”</p>

<p>Charles gave way instantly.</p>

<p>“There’s no need for that, Sir Frank, I’m sure.
Sir Hercules McNaught wouldn’t think of acting
contrary to your opinion without consulting you first.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
It doesn’t look to him as if the case could be carried
much further; that’s all.”</p>

<p>“We are only at the beginning of the inquiry,”
was the firm answer. “You haven’t yet completed
your search among the costumiers.”</p>

<p>The Inspector shook his head despondently.</p>

<p>“We have pretty well exhausted the list of costumiers,
and there is nothing worth reporting, sir.
At least the Commissioner thinks it absurd to attach
any importance to Miss Neobard’s presence. He says
she would have had much better opportunities of getting
hold of her step-father’s keys at home.”</p>

<p>My chief glanced at me. It was the same objection
that he had made himself.</p>

<p>“We can’t hear anything of a leopard skin,”
Charles pursued. “You may remember, sir, that
you expressed the opinion that the leopardess costume
would turn out to be a private one. And the
only Zenobia costume we can trace was furnished a
year ago.”</p>

<p>I stole a glance at the consultant. His keen eyes
were no longer on me.</p>

<p>“To whom was it furnished?” he asked quietly.</p>

<p>The Inspector took out a note-book and opened it.</p>

<p>“To the Lady Violet Bredwardine, Grosvenor
Place.”</p>

<p>At last the name had been pronounced, the name
that I had so much dreaded to hear on the lips of
the police. Fortunately I had known that it was
coming. I had braced my nerves to meet the shock,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
and I managed to preserve an air of complete indifference
while I faced the speaker.</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>Tarleton spoke a little sharply. Captain Charles
looked at him in mild wonder.</p>

<p>“Well?” the specialist repeated impatiently.
“What have you ascertained about Lady Violet
Bredwardine?”</p>

<p>Charles was plainly put out by the question.</p>

<p>“Her ladyship is the daughter of the Earl of
Ledbury. She is quite young—hardly of age. Sir
Hercules McNaught has met her in society.” His
manner conveyed that there was some impropriety
in making Lady Violet’s name the subject of discussion.
The day before I had been inclined to feel
some contempt for the worthy Captain, but now I
was only grateful for his stolid front.</p>

<p>My chief took a very different view, unfortunately.</p>

<p>“And is that all you have thought it worth while
to find out? A peerage would have told us as much
as that. I have no doubt that Sir Hercules has met
many members of the Domino Club in society. It
doesn’t follow that they are to be excluded from
the investigation.”</p>

<p>This time the Inspector did not attempt to conceal
his mortification.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, Sir Frank. Do you mean
that Lady Violet Bredwardine is a member of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
Domino Club? I hadn’t the slightest reason to
suppose so.”</p>

<p>It was the consultant’s turn to show surprise.
He stared at me.</p>

<p>“Surely her name was on the list I asked you
to furnish to Captain Charles? I have a distinct
recollection of it.”</p>

<p>I received the question, for which I had been
waiting, with perfect coolness.</p>

<p>“I seem to recollect it too, sir.”</p>

<p>The Inspector was already turning over the pages
of his note-book. He looked up at us in triumph.</p>

<p>“I made a copy of the list exactly as I received
it, Sir Frank, and the name is not here. I am prepared
to swear that her ladyship’s name was not
included.”</p>

<p>Tarleton turned to me.</p>

<p>“Will you be good enough to bring me the list
I gave you to copy. It looks as though some slip
had been made.”</p>

<p>I had not ventured to destroy the document. To
have done so would have been to expose myself to a
serious rebuke, without serving any useful purpose.
Tarleton was not the man to forget such a name as
Lady Violet’s—one of the first that had attracted his
attention among those that appeared in Weathered’s
appointment-book with a number attached to them.
All I had hoped to do was to keep the police off her
track for a few hours, and that object had now
been achieved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>The list was actually in my breast pocket, but I
went up to my room as though to fetch it, and
returned, carrying it in my hand. I put on an
apologetic air as I handed it to my chief.</p>

<p>“The name is certainly here, sir. I can only
suppose that I must have left it out of the copy I
made for Captain Charles.”</p>

<p>Tarleton let me off more lightly than I expected.</p>

<p>“Either you or the Captain left it out, that’s
dear,” he said gruffly. “The point is that Lady
Violet was not only a member of the Club; she
was also one of Weathered’s patients, which means
that she may have been in his power, and she was
one of those to whom he had given a special number
for some reason that we have still to find out. Perhaps
she may be able to tell us.”</p>

<p>I could scarcely suppress a shiver. This point
had never occurred to me. I pictured to myself the
question being put to the unhappy girl, and tortured
myself with wondering what would be her reply.</p>

<p>The Inspector’s attitude had undergone a considerable
change as he listened to Tarleton’s information.
Evidently he realized that the police
authorities had been rather hasty in coming to the
conclusion that the inquiry was at an end.</p>

<p>“What you tell me makes a great difference,
sir,” he observed regretfully. “I’ve no doubt the
Commissioner will see the necessity of going further
into the case, on this evidence.”</p>

<p>“There are many reasons for going into it further,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
the specialist returned. “You may tell the
Commissioner from me that I suspect a book has
been taken from Dr. Weathered’s safe containing
the names and confidential confessions of his patients,
and it is of the utmost importance that that book
should be traced. Until we know that it is destroyed
the reputations of innocent people will be in danger.
You may also tell him that there is grave reason to
fear that some unscrupulous person in London is in
possession of a supply of deadly poison, unknown to
science at present; and unless that person can be discovered
and the poison taken out of his or her
possession, it may be used to commit more murders
than one.”</p>

<p>Captain Charles’s expression was almost humble.</p>

<p>“You may rely on the Commissioner’s giving
you all the assistance in his power, Sir Frank, I’m
certain. I’ll follow up Lady Violet Bredwardine
without delay, if that will meet your views.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. There are two things I should
like you to report to me the moment you know them:
Lady Violet’s present address, and where she was
yesterday night.”</p>

<p>The Inspector scribbled two lines in his note-book,
and hurried off.</p>

<p>Meanwhile my position was becoming more difficult
every hour. I had to look on and see the toils
closing round one whom I would have given my life
to protect, without daring to show the least sign of
personal interest in her fate. My own peril, serious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
as it was, affected me but little in comparison with
hers. I can honestly say that I should have been
ready to draw suspicion on myself if I could have
screened her by so doing. But the very reverse was
the case, as I knew too well. The only course open
to me was to hold my tongue, to keep a strict guard
on myself, and to watch for any chance that might
present itself of diverting suspicion from either
of us.</p>

<p>I was afraid to commit myself by any expression
of opinion on the case as it stood against Lady Violet,
but I thought I might venture to remind my chief
that she was not the only person implicated. He had
dismissed Sarah Neobard altogether from the inquiry,
or so it seemed, but the mysterious Leopardess
remained to be identified. I ventured on a question.</p>

<p>“Do you think, Sir Frank, there is any chance
of the police getting on the trail of the woman who
wore the leopard skin? According to the waiter’s
evidence she was the one who showed most hostility
to Weathered. She refused to dance with him, you
may remember. Somehow Gerard gave me the impression
that she was his only real enemy.”</p>

<p>I was gratified by Tarleton’s quick response.</p>

<p>“You are perfectly right, Cassilis. That is the
very point I was considering before you spoke. In
my opinion there is very little likelihood of Charles
tracing that woman. I think you and I must try our
hand.”</p>

<p>I need scarcely say how delighted I was at this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
prospect. At last I should be able to devote myself
to serving my chief without any dread of the result.</p>

<p>“Will it be possible to trace the leopard skin?”
I asked. “There are not many taxidermists in
London, are there? I have only heard of one. We
might go round to them, and find out if any skins
have passed through their hands recently. What
strikes me is that all the skins I have seen have been
mounted as rugs. I shouldn’t think that unmounted
skins could be very common—skins that could be
made part of a costume.”</p>

<p>My chief had punctuated these suggestions with
a series of approving nods. At the close he spoke.</p>

<p>“Very good indeed, Cassilis. You have the makings
of a detective, I can see. And now let me explain
to you where I see a chance of success. You may
put the taxidermists on one side. Leopard skins are
such perishable things, and the climates in which
leopards are killed are so treacherous, that the skins
have to be roughly cured on the spot if they are to be
preserved. And they are too common to be the
object of much care afterwards as a rule. The
chances are against any particular skin having passed
through the hands of a taxidermist in London unless
it was to be mounted as a rug.”</p>

<p>I felt very small as I listened to this reduction
of my ideas to nothing. The specialist had not done.</p>

<p>“I don’t think it would be at all hopeful to try
to trace the skin, therefore. But I think it quite possible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
to trace something else. Do you remember what
else about the costume the man Gerard described?”</p>

<p>“Do you mean the necklace—of leopard’s
claws?” I responded in doubt.</p>

<p>“Yes. I see you don’t grasp the significance of
the claws. I must tell you that the natives of the
countries where leopards are found look upon the
claws as having a magical virtue. They place a
great value on them, and take them from the dead
leopard at the first opportunity they find. It is almost
impossible for the white man who shoots a leopard
to secure the claws. I doubt if more than one entire
set of claws comes to England in a year. Now you
see that in my opinion we have a very much greater
chance of tracing the claws than the skin.”</p>

<p>I was fairly puzzled. I could follow Tarleton’s
reasoning, of course, but I could not imagine how
he meant to proceed.</p>

<p>“These claws must have been brought home,
according to my idea, by a sportsman and traveller
of experience, who knew the ways of the natives,
and was able to baffle them. Men of that class are
not very numerous, and most of them have published
books of their travels. I am going to spend the rest
of the morning in going to the libraries and publishers;
and I want you to spend it in the Natural
History Museum at South Kensington.”</p>

<p>There was no occasion for me to express the admiration
I sincerely felt for my chief’s knowledge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
and resource. I waited in silent wonder for his
instructions.</p>

<p>“I am not an expert in zoölogy,” he said modestly.
“I know, of course, that leopards, or animals
closely resembling leopards, are found along the tropical
zone. They are called jaguars in South America,
I believe, and panthers elsewhere. At all events their
skins are sufficiently like the true leopard’s to be called
leopard skins by an ignorant man like Gerard. What
I want you to do is to ascertain if such animals occur
in the East Indian archipelago, and particularly in the
Island of Sumatra.”</p>

<p>It was a curious direction. What was there in
the circumstances of the case to turn Sir Frank’s
mind to one part of the tropics rather than another,
and to one particular island? Perhaps it showed
some dullness on my part; I can only confess that I
had not the least idea of his motive.</p>

<p>“Sumatra,” he repeated in a meditative tone,
“almost the largest island in the world, and yet the
least known. Nominally it is a Dutch possession,
but the Dutch have never subjugated it. They have
never thoroughly penetrated the interior. The natives
have been too fierce for them to subdue. They
occupy one or two points on the coast, I fancy, but
that is all. There was a Sultan of Acheen who
fought with them at one time. I don’t think he was
really conquered. A very interesting field for an
explorer willing to take his life in his hand.”</p>

<p>And still I failed to grasp the mysterious connection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
between the vast unknown island lying on the
Equator and the tragedy I had all but witnessed in a
night club of London.</p>

<p>“You can take my card,” the specialist added.
“You will find the people at the Museum most
obliging. If they have the information they will give
it to you willingly.”</p>

<p>I took the card, and the Piccadilly Tube from
Russell Square soon landed me at South Kensington.
As Sir Frank Tarleton had foretold, the staff of the
Natural History Museum received it with all respect,
and showed themselves ready to give all the information
they possessed. The gentleman who took me in
hand was confident that there were leopards in Sumatra;
nevertheless, when it came to the question of
positive evidence he found some difficulty in putting
his hand on any.</p>

<p>“You have struck the least-known area in the
world, you see,” he pointed out. “We know the
fauna of the Malay Peninsula, and of Java and all
the other East Indian islands as far as the Philippines,
and one has always taken it for granted that
the fauna of Sumatra corresponded with that of the
neighbouring area north of the Wallace line. But
if you ask me for an official declaration that leopards
are to be found in the island I don’t think I can give
it off-hand. We might be able to get the information
by writing to The Hague. Or you might find
it in some book of travels in the British Museum
Library.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>“Sir Frank Tarleton is searching in the Library
at this moment, I believe,” I said incautiously.</p>

<p>My guide opened his eyes.</p>

<p>“You surprise me. I had no idea that Sir Frank
was so much interested in natural history. I have
always associated his name with toxicology.”</p>

<p>The light burst on me at last. I understood the
true reason for my chief’s extreme interest in following
up the clue of the leopard’s claws, and for his
turning his special attention to the region of the
earth least known to science. He had perceived a
connection overlooked by me between the rare necklace
worn by the unknown woman in the Domino
Club and the gray powder contained in the small
glass bottle in his private safe. He was on the
search for some other product of Sumatra besides its
leopards. He expected to trace the secret drug whose
presence the effects of the opium had concealed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

SARAH NEOBARD SPEAKS OUT</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When I</span> returned to Montague Street to lunch,
my host was still out, and I had to sit down to the
meal without him. No uncommon incident this, in
the case of any member of the medical profession,
and especially one liable to be summoned at any moment
to cases of the most desperate nature. Yet I
was uneasy at losing sight of the great man for so
long just then. The investigation had reached a
point at which I was desperately anxious to follow
his every move, in order that I might guard the
threatened girl towards whom so many signs already
seemed to point.</p>

<p>My lunch was nearly over when I was summoned
to the telephone. I answered the call with the expectation
that Captain Charles had obtained the information
he had been asked for; and I was not
disappointed.</p>

<p>“You can tell Sir Frank that Lady Violet Bredwardine
is down in Herefordshire at her father’s
seat, Tyberton Castle. She left London for the
Castle the day before yesterday by the noon train,
so that she can’t have been present at the Domino
Club.”</p>

<p>I was careful to receive this intelligence as though
it were news to me. I even asked the Inspector if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
he was perfectly sure that his informants were to
be trusted.</p>

<p>“I’m perfectly sure as far as this end is concerned,”
he answered in a tone of surprise. “There
is no doubt that she left by that train, and that she
hasn’t returned. And her letters are being forwarded
to Tyberton Castle. But, of course, I can’t answer
for her being there without sending someone down
to make inquiries on the spot. Would Sir Frank
like me to do that?”</p>

<p>I hesitated. I had no reason to fear the result
of such inquiries, but I distrusted the tact of Charles
and his men, and felt afraid lest their proceedings
should come to Lady Violet’s ears and frighten her.
On the whole, I thought it best to apply the brake.</p>

<p>“Sir Frank is out just now. I will let him have
your report as soon as he comes in, and let you know
what he says. I shouldn’t think he would want you to
do anything more. It looks as though Lady Violet
had a complete alibi.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but——” the voice through the wire objected,
“but Sir Frank’s instructions were that I was
to follow up Lady Violet. The police were to follow
up everyone on the list you sent me, and find out
all they could about them. I have a man detailed for
each already. We have ascertained that Julia Sebright
is dead. Sir George Castleton is abroad; he
was last heard of in Naples, in very queer company....”</p>

<p>This was the sort of thing I had dreaded. At<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
all risks I must try to call the hounds off the trail
of Violet Bredwardine’s past.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, so far,” I interrupted. “Of
course, Sir Frank wishes you to follow them all up
as long as there is any possibility of their being involved
in the case. But when they are clearly out
of it I feel sure he wouldn’t think it right to pry
into their private lives for nothing. It would be
taking an improper advantage of information obtained
from the books of their doctor. Medical etiquette
is very strict on that point, I can assure you.
Sir Frank Tarleton himself might get into trouble
if it were known that he had made use of Dr. Weathered’s
books for such a purpose.”</p>

<p>“What is that about Sir Frank Tarleton getting
into trouble?” said a voice in my ear.</p>

<p>The receiver fell from my hand. I looked round
to see my chief standing at my elbow. I am a poor
dissembler, I fear. I was conscious of a deep flush
as I lowered my eyes before the reproachful look in
those keen gray ones beneath their frowning brows.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, sir,” I stammered. “I was
trying to explain to Inspector Charles that it wouldn’t
do to annoy Weathered’s patients with inquiries into
their private lives unless there were some grounds
for suspicion against them.”</p>

<p>Tarleton stepped to the telephone.</p>

<p>“You have heard what Dr. Cassilis said? He
is perfectly right. We have no concern with any
patient of Weathered’s who is not implicated in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
murder. The moment we can dismiss them from the
case they must be let alone.”</p>

<p>I hardly know whether I was more astonished
or delighted at this handsome endorsement of my
words. But I was not yet out of the wood. My
chief made the Inspector repeat the information he
had just given to me, and Charles naturally took the
opportunity to defend himself.</p>

<p>Apparently the Inspector explained to Tarleton
that I had not seemed satisfied at first with his report
about Lady Violet having gone to Herefordshire
before the night of the dance.</p>

<p>It was the physician’s turn to show surprise.</p>

<p>“Why did you question Lady Violet Bredwardine’s
alibi, Cassilis?”</p>

<p>It gratified me to feel that the Inspector had
done me a good turn unawares.</p>

<p>“I merely thought it right to ask Captain
Charles if he was quite satisfied before I took the
responsibility of reporting the alibi to you. He offered
to send a man down to make inquiries at Lord
Ledbury’s seat, and I asked him to take no further
steps without your sanction.”</p>

<p>My chief smiled with the utmost amiability.</p>

<p>“Dr. Cassilis has exactly understood my views,”
he said through the telephone. “There is not the
least necessity for you to trouble yourself further
about Lady Violet for the present. The person in
whom I am interested just now is Captain Armstrong,
R.A. He is a Fellow of the Royal Geographical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
Society, and a well-known traveller and
explorer. I shall be glad if you can let me have his
present address.”</p>

<p>There was a brief pause. It was evident that
the Inspector had been consulting his note-book,
for his reply, which I failed to catch, provoked
Tarleton to say testily, “I know, I know. He is not
on the books of the Club. I want to get in touch
with him for another reason. I think he may be of
help in enabling me to decide on the cause of death.”</p>

<p>As soon as Captain Charles had been disposed of,
the physician came to the luncheon table and made a
hasty meal. I reported my failure to obtain any definite
proof of the existence of leopards in Sumatra,
and found that the point had lost its importance in
his eyes.</p>

<p>“I have been to the British Museum Reading
Room,” he told me. “I met Captain Armstrong
about two years ago, after reading his book on Sumatra,
but I had forgotten his name, and I had to
look through the subject index under the head of
Sumatra to find it. Then I got out his book, <i>Across
Sumatra</i>, and saw from the title-page that he had
also written a book on West Africa, where everyone
knows there are leopards, so that he had plenty of
opportunities of procuring skins and claws.”</p>

<p>The situation was becoming clearer and clearer.
There was no need for me to ask the specialist where
he had procured the contents of the glass bottle. I
could see what must have happened. The explorer’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
narrative must have contained some account of an
unknown poison peculiar to the Island of Sumatra;
the expert’s attention had been drawn to it; he had
approached the author, found that he had some of
the poison in his possession, and induced him to part
with it. His object now must be to find out whether
Armstrong had kept any himself, or allowed it to
get into other hands.</p>

<p>I was so relieved at the turn the investigation was
taking that I had ceased to worry about my own connection
with the tragedy. It gave me a disagreeable
shock to be reminded that there were other points to
be cleared up, when my chief spoke again.</p>

<p>“I think our next step now must be to interview
Sarah Neobard. I doubt if she has told us all she
knows about Weathered and his woman patients.
She may be able to throw some light on the mysterious
numbers.”</p>

<p>The numbers in the appointment-book were as
mysterious to me as they were to him. I had been
able to form no theory as to their significance; nevertheless,
I felt that danger lay in that direction. I
could not forget that a number had been attached
to Violet Bredwardine’s name, and I dreaded to
learn why.</p>

<p>The physician was provided with a good excuse
for presenting himself again at the house in Warwick
Street. It was necessary to make arrangements
for the interment of the body. He had decided, he
told me, to give a certificate that would dispense with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
the necessity for an inquest, and permit of the funeral
taking place without delay. For that purpose the
body was to be conveyed to the house in the small
hours when nobody was likely to be about.</p>

<p>It was a strong thing to do before it had yet been
determined whether the murder was to be made the
subject of a public prosecution, and the murderer
brought to justice. So far as I could see, the authorities
both of the Home Office and the Foreign Office
were placing entire confidence in my chief, and had
given him a free hand. I hoped accordingly that his
decision to let the funeral proceed quietly meant that
he had made up his mind against any public exposure.
But on that point he had been careful not
to commit himself, and I was afraid to show too
much curiosity.</p>

<p>He took me round with him in the car to Warwick
Street, and asked to see Mrs. Weathered. The
youthful butler eyed us with the utmost apprehension,
and showed us into the patients’ waiting-room.
There we were joined presently by the widow and
her daughter.</p>

<p>Mrs. Weathered was in deep black. Her manner
showed that she was resigned to her husband’s
fate by this time, but she was evidently in a state of
extreme nervousness, as she well might be while the
mystery was unsolved. Sarah, on the other hand,
at the beginning of the interview, was as cold and
self-possessed as though her part was over, and she
had ceased to feel any personal interest in the sequel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>“I have called on you,” Tarleton explained, “to
let you know officially that I have examined into the
cause of Dr. Weathered’s death, and am prepared to
certify that it was due to heart failure.”</p>

<p>I stared. In one sense, of course, almost every
death may be said to be due to heart failure. The
question generally is what has caused the heart to
fail; and I knew perfectly well that the burial certificate
would have to be more explicit. But Mrs.
Weathered showed herself quite satisfied.</p>

<p>“Then it was a natural death, after all?” she
exclaimed in relief.</p>

<p>“There is no reason why you shouldn’t regard it
so,” was the answer. “I should advise you to accept
that view, and refrain from discussing the matter
with anyone. I wish to spare you the trouble and
unpleasantness of an inquest, if possible. I propose
to have the body brought round here some time to-night,
or rather in the early morning; and you can
then make your own arrangements for the funeral.”</p>

<p>The widow clasped her hands in gratification.</p>

<p>“That is good of you, Sir Frank. I don’t know
how to thank you.” She looked up at her daughter,
whose face was overcast. “My dear, we couldn’t
have asked for anything better. I have been dreading
the inquest more than I can say.”</p>

<p>Sarah’s expression was troubled. She tried to
return her mother’s pleading look with one of sympathy.
Then she lifted her head, and let her eyes
rest on the consultant with quiet scorn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>“My mother has every reason to be grateful to
you, Sir Frank,” she said ungraciously. “But you
haven’t told us what caused the heart to fail.”</p>

<p>Tarleton returned her gaze with quiet forbearance.
It was in his power to crush her with an allusion
to her presence at the Domino Club in the
character of Salome, but he generously refrained
from doing so in her mother’s hearing. Already the
poor woman’s face was downcast again, and she
glanced anxiously from her daughter to us.</p>

<p>“That is a question which Mrs. Weathered is
entitled to raise if she pleases,” the doctor said
gravely. “You have just heard me advise her not
to do so. At the same time if you would like to go
into the question with me privately I am quite
willing.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no!” The protest broke from the
widow’s lips. She caught hold of her daughter’s
hand. “Don’t say anything more, dear. I’m sure
Sir Frank Tarleton knows best. We must do what
he tells us.”</p>

<p>The girl compressed her lips with a strong effort.
Her eye sought Tarleton’s and I thought a signal was
exchanged between them. Then he rose to his feet.</p>

<p>“Very well, ma’am. I think you are acting
wisely. By the way, there is one question which you
may be able to answer. In looking through Dr.
Weathered’s diary of appointments with his patients
I have noticed that some of their names are followed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
by numbers, and I should like to know what that
means.”</p>

<p>The widow received the question with an air of
complete surprise. It was impossible to doubt her
declaration that she had no idea of the existence of
the curious ciphers, much less of their use. But
Sarah gave the questioner a quick look, and again
I thought a secret understanding was established between
them.</p>

<p>The first words uttered by my chief, when we
were in the car driving away, told me what the understanding
was.</p>

<p>“That girl means to come and see me. She isn’t
satisfied; and she won’t be without vengeance on the
woman she hates.”</p>

<p>The prediction was promptly fulfilled. The girl
must have found some excuse for leaving the house
within a few minutes after us. We had been back
less than half an hour when she was announced.
She burst in upon us like a fury.</p>

<p>“Sir Frank Tarleton, what does this mean? My
step-father was murdered, and you know it. You
are trying to hush up the case, I suppose, because
some of the people involved in it are so high up that
the police want to let them off. There seems to be
one law for the rich and another for the poor. It’s
the high-up people, the people with titles, who are
the worst. I’ve seen those numbers in the diary, and
I can guess pretty well what they mean. They’re
the guilty patients, the ones who were in his power,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
and had the greatest motive to murder him. If you
want to know more you had better apply to Lady
Violet Bredwardine.”</p>

<p>It was an appalling shock. Just as I had reached
the comforting conclusion that Lady Violet’s alibi
had put an end to the investigation as far as she was
concerned, this passionate girl had launched a denunciation
that threatened to drag everything to light.
I turned in consternation to my chief.</p>

<p>He had taken out his gold repeater and begun to
swing it to and fro at the end of its scrap of ribbon
in a way that told me he was pondering deeply on this
new development of the case. He made a motion
with his hand towards me.</p>

<p>“Dr. Cassilis, here, can tell you that you are mistaken
in thinking that the police are trying to hush
up the case, or to screen anyone connected with it.
Tell Miss Neobard what they reported to you.”</p>

<p>The indignant Sarah faced me in some surprise.
My own surprise was greater than hers. I was at a
loss to understand Tarleton’s motive for handing
over the vindication of the police to me. Did he
expect my word to carry more weight with the excited
girl than his own? Or was he simply testing
my ability to deal with a critical situation? And if
so, how far did he mean me to go? Was I to let the
accuser know that the police had been on her track as
well as Lady Violet’s? I spoke in some confusion.</p>

<p>“The police have made full inquiries about Lady
Violet Bredwardine. She was a patient of Dr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
Weathered’s and a member of the Domino Club,
apparently. But they have ascertained that she
wasn’t in London on the night when he met his
death. She was down at her father’s place in Herefordshire.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it,” was the angry reply. “I
don’t mean that you are trying to deceive me, but
the police haven’t told you the truth. I am as certain
that she was there that night as I am that I am in
this room. She was with him in the very alcove
where he was found dead.”</p>

<p>In her wrath she had given herself away. Her
statement almost amounted to saying that she had
seen them together. I looked at my chief in the
hope that he would pounce on the admission, but he
contented himself with nodding to me to go on.</p>

<p>“You speak very positively, Miss Neobard. May
I ask you how you know that?”</p>

<p>The question plainly disconcerted her. It must
have opened her eyes to the fact that she was saying
too much.</p>

<p>“I don’t see what that has to do with it,” she
answered stubbornly. “You can ask anyone who
was there. Ask them if they saw someone wearing
a Roman helmet and breastplate with a skirt underneath.
That was her disguise.”</p>

<p>I was staggered. The girl’s persistence irritated
me, and I spoke sharply.</p>

<p>“You can’t possibly know that, when she was
more than a hundred miles away at the time. Did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
you speak to her—to whoever it was that was wearing
that costume?”</p>

<p>It appeared that I had let myself go too far this
time. I saw Tarleton frown disapprovingly. Sarah
Neobard gazed at me in alarm.</p>

<p>“I speak to her?” she echoed. “What do you
mean? I wasn’t—I’m not a member of the Club.”</p>

<p>A warning glance from my chief stopped the
retort that was on my lips. I was longing to tell the
accuser that she had been under suspicion herself,
but I saw that in Tarleton’s opinion I was taking the
wrong line. My indignation on Violet Bredwardine’s
behalf had betrayed me into showing our cards
too soon.</p>

<p>The girl herself seemed to feel that some explanation
was needed for her confident assertions.</p>

<p>“If you want to know who was wearing that disguise,
ask Madame Bonnell. She is the manager of
the Club, and she can tell you everything that went
on there.”</p>

<p>A swift movement of the physician’s eyebrows
told me that this was the sort of admission he had
been watching for. He intervened, I had little doubt,
to prevent my drawing attention to it.</p>

<p>“I think Miss Neobard ought to be told that the
wearer of the Zenobia costume was not the only one
whose movements attracted attention on that night.”</p>

<p>I was eager to take the cue. It was time to give
Lady Violet’s enemy a taste of her own medicine.</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said sternly, “the dancer who was seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
oftenest in company with Dr. Weathered that night
wore the costume of Salome. Can you tell us anything
about her?”</p>

<p>For an instant Salome blanched. She was quite
intelligent enough to see the red light. She didn’t
need to be told that if her movements had attracted
the notice of the police her identity could hardly fail
to come out before very long, if it hadn’t come out
already. Yet she struggled against what was coming.</p>

<p>“She had nothing to do with the crime. She was
a friend of Dr. Weathered’s. Her only motive for
being there was to protect him from the other
women.” She spoke almost in a whisper.</p>

<p>“To protect him from being poisoned, do you
mean? Or do you mean that she was jealous, and
wanted to prevent him from dancing with anyone
but herself?”</p>

<p>At last Tarleton had fired the shot which he had
had in preparation. Its effect was startling indeed.
A dark red flood overspread the girl’s face; for a
moment she fought with her emotions, and the next
she broke down in a flood of tears.</p>

<p>“You know it was I,” she sobbed out. “You
have been playing with me. You think I am a bad
woman, I suppose. But I’m not. I take Heaven to
witness that I only meant to do what was right. I
never dreamed that I had any feeling for him that—that
wasn’t—that wasn’t right. I was angry with
him for the way he treated my mother. When he
began to neglect her and go after other women, pretending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
that they were only his patients, I hated
them. I never thought of anything else. I thought I
was doing my duty to my mother in watching him.
But he found me out. He knew everything about
women. He saw that I was jealous on my own
account as well; and he set himself to soothe me.
He could fascinate any woman if he tried. He pretended
to confide in me. He told me about his
patients, and complained that they wouldn’t leave
him alone. Sometimes I believed him, and thought
it was their fault, and then I thought it was his. I
didn’t know what to think at last. I went there that
night to see if I could find out....”</p>

<p>The broken utterance ended in a wail of grief.</p>

THE CASE AGAINST LADY VIOLET</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I felt</span> honestly sorry for the poor girl in spite
of the vindictive attitude she had taken up just before.
I had no doubt that she was quite sincere, and
that she had unconsciously deceived herself as to her
real feelings up to the last moment.</p>

<p>Tarleton remained calm in the face of her outburst;
when he spoke again his tone was courteous
but businesslike—perhaps the most considerate one
to adopt in the circumstances.</p>

<p>“You have told Dr. Cassilis and me very little
that we weren’t prepared to hear, and nothing that
we aren’t able to understand and allow for. But now
we have to ask you for some information. In the
first place I should like to know how you obtained
admission to the Domino Club.”</p>

<p>Sarah made an effort to collect herself. As far
as I could judge she was telling the truth, up to a
certain point at all events.</p>

<p>“I bought a ticket of admission from Madame
Bonnell.”</p>

<p>We both started and exchanged looks of surprise.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say that anybody could get in
by paying?” the consultant asked.</p>

<p>Sarah shook her head.</p>

<p>“I don’t know that anybody could. But there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
didn’t seem to be much difficulty. I think it was
pretty well known, in Chelsea and in Kensington,
that you could buy a ticket from Madame Bonnell.
She made a great favour of it, but I expect that was
only to keep up the price.”</p>

<p>“What was the price?”</p>

<p>“Five pounds. She entered your name in a book,
and the name of some member of the Club who was
supposed to be introducing you; but whether it was
a real name or not I don’t know.”</p>

<p>Tarleton smiled grimly.</p>

<p>“I’m beginning to understand why Madame
made so much fuss over giving up her books. She
must have made a good thing out of the Club in one
way and another. Did she know who you were?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! At least, I didn’t tell her. I gave my
name as Mrs. Antrobus.”</p>

<p>“I remember that name in the Visitors’-book,”
I put in.</p>

<p>My chief nodded. “Did she say anything to you
about the disguise you were to come in?”</p>

<p>“Yes. She asked me what I was going to wear.
I told her I hadn’t made up my mind, and she recommended
me to go to a place in Coventry Street where
I should be able to see some costumes.”</p>

<p>“Another little side line,” the shrewd examiner
commented. “There’s not much doubt she got a
commission there. She struck me as a good woman
of business.” His face became grave once more.
“And now, Miss Neobard, I must ask you to tell us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
what you know about Lady Violet Bredwardine?”</p>

<p>It was the question I had been dreading. I
dreaded the answer still more.</p>

<p>The accuser flushed. “I know that she was more
than a patient,” she said in a low voice. “I know
that he met her away from the house, at other places
besides the Club.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I must ask you to tell us more than
that. You have practically accused her of poisoning
him. I think you must see that I am entitled to
know whether you have any grounds for throwing
suspicion on her beyond personal ill-will.”</p>

<p>The answer came slowly. It was with a painful
effort that the girl confessed how far her jealousy
had carried her.</p>

<p>“I knew that he was neglecting my mother for
other women. I had known that for some time. He
was almost always out at night, and he never told us
where he had been. I wanted my mother to apply
for a separation, and I thought I ought to get evidence.
I followed him.”</p>

<p>She stopped short, her face burning and her eyes
lowered towards the ground.</p>

<p>“Yes? You have told us already that you followed
him to the Club that night. But you must have
seen them together at other places before?”</p>

<p>The girl nodded. “I have seen them walking
in Regent’s Park. And I have seen them dining
together at....” She whispered the name of a
restaurant in a little side street not far from Piccadilly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
which is well known to Londoners as a place
to which men more often take other people’s wives
and daughters than their own.</p>

<p>Tarleton prudently refrained from asking his witness
anything about her own proceedings. It looked
to me as though she must have placed herself in the
hands of a private inquiry agent, but if so it was
evident that she had insisted on going with him on
the trail.</p>

<p>“Didn’t that seem as if they were friends?”
was the next question.</p>

<p>“No!” The denial was emphatic. “He was
making love to her, anyone could see that, but she
was resisting him. You could see that she hated him.”</p>

<p>“And yet she went about with him.”</p>

<p>“It was against her will, I am certain of it. She
had the air of a prisoner.”</p>

<p>Poor, unhappy Violet! It was hard work to control
myself as I listened, and pictured her sitting in
that doubtful resort, tormented by the vile wooing
of the monster who had her in his power, while her
jealous rival, with a hired spy in attendance, gloated
over her distress.</p>

<p>The merciless accuser went on.</p>

<p>“That night they dined together. I saw him try
to slip a bracelet on to her wrist. She snatched her
hand away so fiercely that it fell on the floor, and
he dropped his napkin over it so as to pick it up
without the waiter seeing.”</p>

<p>The scene was as vividly before me as though it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
was passing on the screen. The eyes of jealousy had
been sharper than the waiter’s.</p>

<p>“Well, let us come to yesterday night. We knew
before you told us that one of the dancers wore the
dress you have described. What makes you so confident
that she was Lady Violet?”</p>

<p>And now indeed I had reason to listen with all
my ears. If this girl convinced my chief that she
was right, the position would be one of deadly danger.</p>

<p>Sarah Neobard didn’t seem to understand the
doubt in his mind.</p>

<p>“Madame Bonnell told me so.”</p>

<p>Tarleton gave me a stare which I returned with
interest. In my excitement I was rash enough to
speak.</p>

<p>“She told you so? Why? How could she know
herself?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.” Sarah looked a little puzzled.
“I suppose she knew everything that went on in
the Club. Before selling me the ticket she asked if
I knew any member. I thought the question was
only put for form’s sake, and I gave Lady Violet’s
name. Afterwards I asked her if Lady Violet was
likely to be there, and if she knew what costume she
was likely to wear. She told me that she was pretty
sure to come, and that she always wore the same
costume. She made me give her an extra guinea for
telling me. I could see she was the sort of woman
who would do anything for money.”</p>

<p>There could be no doubt that this last opinion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
was sound. Unfortunately it was too late for me to
act on it. I held my tongue again, and let my chief
put the next question.</p>

<p>“You watched her, I suppose, during the night?
Did you notice nothing peculiar about her? One of
the waiters seems to have thought it was a man.”</p>

<p>“A man!” The girl’s surprise was unmistakable.
Her jealousy had blinded her that time as much
as it had sharpened her sight the other. “No, I
never thought of noticing anything of that sort. I
hadn’t any reason for it. I believed what I was told.
And she behaved just like Lady Violet. And he certainly
believed it was she. I tried to keep them apart,
but it was no use. I saw him make her come into the
alcove. She went unwillingly, just as I should have
expected. I got near, and watched them through the
curtain. He ordered coffee for both....”</p>

<p>She seemed to pull herself up. Was she telling
a carefully framed story, and hesitating at the last
fatal point? Or was she only shrinking from uttering
the words that might condemn a fellow creature
to death?</p>

<p>“And?” the physician breathed gently.</p>

<p>Sarah braced herself up with a visible effort.</p>

<p>“<i>I saw her drop something into his cup.</i>”</p>

<p>I believed it was a lie. To this hour I believe it.
Sarah Neobard and I are never likely to meet again
on this earth, and I may do her an injustice. Yet on
her showing, if she was to be believed, she had
looked on at what must have seemed to her an attempt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
to murder, and had not lifted a finger to save
the life of the man she half hated and half loved.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the charge had been made, a charge
which the adviser of the Home Office was bound to
act upon, as the look he gave me clearly showed. I
seized on it as an invitation to speak.</p>

<p>“Did you believe that the person, whoever it
was, meant to poison him?” I asked, trying to suppress
my indignation.</p>

<p>“What else could I believe?” She gave the
answer almost rudely, so as to show that she resented
my presuming to question her.</p>

<p>“And you did nothing? You didn’t interfere?”</p>

<p>The accuser flushed angrily. She stumbled over
her reply.</p>

<p>“What could I do? If I had made a scene she
would have denied it, and he would have taken her
part. Besides, it was all over in a moment. He had
drunk his coffee before I had time to do anything.”</p>

<p>“Think again,” I said earnestly. “You are not
on your oath. Are you certain of what you saw?
Remember that you are bringing a charge of murder
against a fellow creature, a young woman who has
done you no wrong, who, you admit yourself, was
your step-father’s innocent victim.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say that. I said she hated him. She
can’t be innocent if she poisoned him.”</p>

<p>“<i>If</i> she poisoned him,” I repeated with emphasis.
“You have heard that she was more than
a hundred miles away, according to the police evidence.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
But the same evidence shows that you were
there, and you have told us as much.”</p>

<p>“What?” The girl almost leaped from her seat
“Are you suggesting that I had anything to do
with it?”</p>

<p>I glanced at my chief for permission to go on.
He was lying back on his chair, his timepiece twisting
between his fingers, apparently listening with the
detachment of an impartial judge.</p>

<p>“You compel me to point out to you the situation
you are in, Miss Neobard,” I continued. “A
death has taken place, the police have inquired into
it, and they have found cause for suspicion against
certain persons. Lady Violet Bredwardine was one
of those persons; you were another. Her innocence
has now been proved. Yours only rests on your own
assertion—or rather it may rest, because so far you
haven’t actually asserted it. Therefore, you have the
strongest possible motive for trying to throw suspicion
on someone else; and you have been doing so
all along. Now at last you have made a direct
charge, and backed it up by stating what you say you
saw through a curtain. I ask you again if you are
certain of what you say, and I ask you to be careful.”</p>

<p>Sarah Neobard’s face underwent a succession of
changes while she listened, from amazement to
wrath and from wrath to abject fear. Tarleton put
the crown on her discomfiture.</p>

<p>“Although we are not policemen, and this is not
a formal charge, Dr. Cassilis is right to caution you,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
he said firmly. “I shall feel at liberty to report
whatever you say to the police.”</p>

<p>The tables were completely turned. The triumphant
accuser found herself all at once standing
in the dock. She gave us both a long deep look of
despairing hatred and dread. Then, with lips tightly
closed, she got up and walked out of the room and
out of the house.</p>

<p>My chief gratified me with a nod and smile of
approval.</p>

<p>“You did that very well, Cassilis; I congratulate
you. I think that young woman’s teeth have
been drawn pretty effectually. It would never have
done for her to be going about accusing the police of
trying to hush up the case. She would have got
some paper to take up her story, and there would
have been the devil to pay.”</p>

<p>“Do you think there is any chance that she was
mixed up in the business?” I asked with hesitation.</p>

<p>Evidently the specialist was displeased by the
question.</p>

<p>“It is not my practice to speculate, as I think I
have told you. I prefer to confine myself to reasoning
on the evidence before me. At present the evidence
points to this death being due to a certain drug,
which must have been administered during the dance
by some person who was present, and who had a
motive for rendering Weathered insensible—the
death may have been due to his or her ignorance of
the power of the drug. We now have direct evidence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
which may be true, that the drug was put into
his coffee by the dancer disguised as Zenobia, and
we have further evidence that that costume was supplied
to Lady Violet Bredwardine about a year ago,
and was regularly worn by her in the Domino Club.</p>

<p>“Add to that the appearance of her name in the
list of suspects compiled from Weathered’s diary and
the Club register, and the story we have just heard
of her being pursued by Weathered and persecuted
with attentions which she resented. It is a case on
which very few juries would hesitate to convict.</p>

<p>“Against that we have nothing but an idle suspicion
on the part of a waiter that the wearer of the
Zenobia costume on this particular night was a man,
and the police information that Lady Violet left
London by a midday train. Of course she may have
got out anywhere, and been back long before night.”</p>

<p>What was I to say? What ought I to do? Had
the time come for me to make the confession I had
held back even more for Violet Bredwardine’s sake
than for my own? I shuddered at the thought that
what I had to tell might not exonerate her—that it
might deepen the suspicion against her, if it were
believed. And suppose it should not be believed?
What excuse could I make for having put it off so
long? Would not Sir Frank Tarleton have every
right to doubt me, and to think that my story was a
false one invented at the eleventh hour to save the
true culprit?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>There was one slender plank to cling to. I was
confident that Lady Violet’s alibi was genuine. If
the question of her guilt or innocence could be made
to depend on that, I had no fear of the result.</p>

<p>“In that case, sir, wouldn’t it be best for the
police to go down to Herefordshire, and make sure
whether she was there or not?”</p>

<p>To my surprise Tarleton raised the objection that
had held me back before.</p>

<p>“I think not. Captain Charles isn’t a particularly
tactful man himself, and we can’t trust to his
employing a very tactful agent. Whether Lady Violet
is innocent or guilty she ought not to be alarmed.
It seems to me far the best course for me to go down
myself, and call on her openly.”</p>

<p>I was startled by the proposal. I hardly knew
whether to welcome it or not. Certainly the consultant
was less likely to frighten Violet than the
police were, but on the other hand he was much more
likely to find out whatever was to be found.</p>

<p>“Won’t that come to the same thing?” I objected
feebly. “If she knows you have come to
question her about Weathered’s death?”</p>

<p>“I may not have to question her about his death,”
the specialist put in sharply. “Have you forgotten
the numbers in the appointment-book? I propose to
ask Lady Violet if she can explain what they
signify!”</p>

<p>I was silenced. I could think of no possible objection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
to such a course. It was clear that the explanation
must be obtained from someone, and
equally clear that Lady Violet was most likely to be
able to give it. My chief’s plan was worthy of his
shrewdness. He would be killing two birds with one
stone,—gaining information he needed, and at the
same time quietly testing the information of the
police.</p>

<p>Tarleton gave me no time for further reflection.</p>

<p>“Just look up the trains for Hereford,” he said
briskly.</p>

<p>I hastened to obey. “Am I coming with you,
sir?”</p>

<p>I put the question almost without hope. I was
overjoyed by the answer.</p>

<p>“Why, yes, I think you ought to, in fairness to
the poor girl. You have defended her very well
from her enemy. I look on you as her advocate.
I think you ought to be present and help her if
you can.”</p>

<p>He spoke with a mixture of seriousness and playfulness
that left me in doubt whether he had really
noticed anything to suggest that I took a personal
interest in Lady Violet’s defence. I was glad to
feel that in any case he had no animosity against
her. Even if he thought her guilty of Weathered’s
death, it was probable that he saw some excuse for
the deed.</p>

<p>Nothing more passed between us on the subject<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
till we were in the train for Hereford. During a
great part of the journey the consultant sat silent in
his corner seat, with his golden pendulum swinging
softly in his hand, to the evident astonishment of the
solitary passenger who shared our compartment.</p>

<p>I sat opposite him, filled with bitter-sweet reflections
and memories that became more intense as we
neared the little city on its rushing river beyond the
Malvern Hills. How every feature in the landscape
recalled the passionate days of yore, when I had
made that journey for the first time! Then I had
travelled third-class with a knapsack on my back, and
the hopes of youth in my heart, on my way to explore
the romantic hills and vales of the borderland, the
Golden Valley and the untrodden Beacons that looked
down on Breconshire. I recalled every step of the
way, from the morning on which I had turned my
face to the west and tramped out towards the wooded
slopes of Blakemere, to the hour when I had encountered
in its romantic setting that figure which became
for me all that Queen Guinevere had been for
Lancelot.</p>

<p>Less than four years had passed since then, and
now I was returning to the scene of my wrecked
romance, my unforgotten secret agony; returning
in official dignity as a representative of the law
charged to examine the partner of my secret on a
fearful accusation from which perhaps only I could
save her, and only at the cost of my own life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>That night I did not sleep. I passed it in wrestling
with the problem, as I tossed from side to
side on my bed in the hotel where we had put up.
But before retiring for the night I had managed
to escape from my chief’s observation for a few
minutes, just long enough to scribble a brief note
and despatch it to Tyberton Castle. It ran:</p>

<p><i>Be out to-morrow morning when Sir Frank
Tarleton arrives. The barn at twelve if possible.
Zenobia.</i></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

WHAT THE CIPHER MEANT</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Tyberton Castle</span> was less than an hour’s drive
from Hereford by motor. I had to conceal my
knowledge of the neighbourhood from Tarleton, who
left the arrangements in my hands, and question the
man who waited on us at breakfast as if I were entirely
ignorant of where the Castle lay, and how to
reach it.</p>

<p>“No breakfast, no man,” was a favourite maxim
of the physician’s, and he did full justice to the fresh
trout, the kidneys and bacon, and the new-laid eggs
put before us, while I had to force myself to swallow
a few mouthfuls. However, the meal was over at
last, and at ten o’clock we were seated in the car
provided by the hotel, speeding along the road I had
last trodden backward with despair in my heart.</p>

<p>It seemed to me that every tree was eloquent and
that every cottage on the way remembered me, and
wondered at my coming back. As we came near the
village I was tempted to shrink back in my corner
of the car and hide my face, lest the villagers should
recognize it and greet me. I had to tell myself that
the real test would come presently. I had never
crossed the threshold of the Castle; I had never
ventured into the park in the daytime; but there is
no such thing as privacy on the country-side; every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
hedge has eyes and ears; and it was certain that
my comings and goings had been watched, and that
every child on the Earl of Ledbury’s estate and
every servant in his house knew more about me than
his lordship did.</p>

<p>Tarleton was delighted with the scenery. What
pleased him still more was the absence of all traffic.
We did not meet one vehicle in the road, except a
farmer’s cart.</p>

<p>“This is the least-known beauty spot in England,”
he cried with enthusiasm. “Those hills yonder
must be in Radnorshire, a county whose existence
I have always doubted. This is the old Welsh
March, where the Britons stayed the Saxon advance
at last, and kept their freedom in Wild Wales. What
a contrast between this and Tarifa Road, Chelsea!”</p>

<p>The reminder came just in time. I had been on
the point of telling him that King Arthur’s tomb
stood on the crest of one of the hills that overlooked
the Golden Valley. I bit my lip, thankful that I
hadn’t betrayed myself.</p>

<p>We went through the sleepy village, bringing out
one or two women with babies in their arms to their
garden gates. Then we turned into the park and
saw the rabbits scampering to the right and left as
we crossed the fern-covered slopes.</p>

<p>“This is a true ‘haunt of ancient peace,’” murmured
the consultant wistfully. “This is the sort of
place I want to end my days in. And we have come
to disturb it, perhaps to bring disaster and disgrace.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
I should be glad if we could turn back now and go
away again.”</p>

<p>I turned to him expectantly. His words had
echoed my own thoughts so closely that I half hoped
to find him ready to act upon them. But the frown
on his brow and the stern set of his mouth told me
that I was deluding myself.</p>

<p>The car drew up at the main entrance to the
Castle. The ivy-clad ruins to which the building
owed its name were almost screened from view by
the huge red-brick front of a dull edifice dating
from the reign of George the Second. The mansion
had been put up out of ostentation at a cost from
which the estate had never recovered, and every
Earl of Ledbury since had cursed his ancestor’s extravagance.
I know that the present Earl found
it hard to pay the interest on his mortgages, and that
he lived in one corner of the vast house, leaving long
corridors and whole suites of rooms to the spiders
and rats.</p>

<p>We got out, and Sir Frank Tarleton gave his
card and mine to the man who came down the steps
to receive us. His suit of black was threadbare, and
his coat looked as if it had been thrust on hastily
at the sound of our approach.</p>

<p>“Please take our cards to Lady Violet Bredwardine,
and ask her ladyship if we can see her
in private, on urgent business.”</p>

<p>The servant stared at the message. His eyes
wandered from Tarleton to me, and I thought there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
was a vague recognition in them when they met
mine. But his manner was respectful and demure.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, sir, but I believe her ladyship is out.
I will inquire if you wish.”</p>

<p>He seemed to be hesitating whether to ask us
inside. Sir Frank seized on the opening.</p>

<p>“I shall be glad if you will find out when she is
likely to be in. Her ladyship is staying in the
Castle, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, sir.” The answer was given readily.</p>

<p>“We have come down from London on purpose
to see her. They told us at Grosvenor Place
that her ladyship had come here—I think it was on
Wednesday.”</p>

<p>The man bowed. “That is quite right, sir. Her
ladyship arrived on Wednesday evening.”</p>

<p>I stole an anxious glance at my chief. It was
a complete confirmation of the Inspector’s report.
If Lady Violet had arrived at the Castle in the evening,
she could not have been back in town the same
night. The alibi stood firm.</p>

<p>Tarleton drew out his watch as though to consult
it before deciding what to do next. Suddenly he
snapped out, “There is no mistake, I suppose? Her
ladyship couldn’t have been in London on Wednesday
night?”</p>

<p>The man was taken off his guard, and if he had
been lying he could hardly have failed to show
some confusion. But the only feeling he manifested
was one of resentment at the question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>“I’m positive of what I say, sir. But her ladyship
hasn’t authorized me to answer questions about
her movements.”</p>

<p>The consultant put on the air of a man who has
made a slip.</p>

<p>“No, no; of course not. I meant to ask her ladyship
herself.” He turned to me. “What do you
say, Cassilis? Shall we wait inside, or shall we go
for a stroll and come back again?”</p>

<p>I had laid my plans in the expectation that Lady
Violet would be out, and I was ready with a suggestion.
I made it with my heart in my mouth.</p>

<p>“I think one of us ought to wait here, Sir Frank.
The other might walk round the park, and perhaps
meet Lady Violet.”</p>

<p>Sir Frank seemed to find the proposal quite
natural.</p>

<p>“Very good. I shall be glad to stretch my legs
for an hour, so I’ll leave you here and come back
again.”</p>

<p>This was an unforeseen check. I had been so
sure of being the one to go out into the grounds, if
I could effect the separation, that I hadn’t thought
of the alternative. My only chance now was to slip
out as soon as Tarleton’s back was turned. I looked
at the servant, and fancied that his eye rested on me
with a more friendly air than on my companion.</p>

<p>“Would you like to wait inside, sir?” he asked.</p>

<p>I hesitated. But I had to choose between trusting
him and trusting the chauffeur who had driven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
us out from Hereford; and he had impressed me
favourably. I followed him into the Castle, while
Tarleton moved off down an avenue of beeches in
the park.</p>

<p>The servant brought me through a dreary hall
full of old suits of armour and ancient high-backed
chairs, but lacking in those little touches of modern
comfort that are needed to make such a place home-like
and attractive to the eye. He opened a door
towards the inner end, and ushered me into a gloomy
library, fitted up with great bookcases that looked
as if they were never opened, stuffed with huge
leather-bound volumes of the kind that no human
being any longer wants to read. The whole room
reminded me of the fairy tale of the Sleeping Beauty
in the Wood. It seemed to breathe of the eighteenth
century, as though its life had been arrested then,
and no one had trodden the faded carpet or taken
down one of the dusty tomes for a hundred long
years since.</p>

<p>The manservant had taken up a silver plate as
we passed through the hall, and laid our cards on it.
He now asked, “Shall I take these cards to his lordship,
sir?”</p>

<p>He must have seen me start at the question. I
put my hand into my pocket, searching his face carefully
the while.</p>

<p>“There is no occasion for that,” I said. “Our
business with her ladyship is private, and she may
not wish his lordship to be troubled with it.” I took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
out a note before adding, “Perhaps you remember
my face?”</p>

<p>The man looked pleased. His chances of adding
to his wages can’t have been very many in that lonely
mansion. It seemed to me, moreover, that he was
genuinely attached to his young mistress.</p>

<p>“Why, yes, sir. I did have a thought as I had
seen you here before. You were staying at the
Moorfield Farm, if I rec’lect rightly, sir, three years
ago or might be four.”</p>

<p>I nodded, and the piece of paper passed silently
from my hand to his.</p>

<p>“I’ve come to do a service to Lady Violet, if I
can,” I told him. “Her ladyship knows I am coming,
and she has gone out to meet me. I want you to
let me out at the back of the Castle, so that I can join
her; and say nothing to the friend who has come
with me, or anybody else.”</p>

<p>He gave me a quick look of intelligence. “I understand,
sir.”</p>

<p>He led the way out of the library again, and
along a corridor still more deserted and dismal than
the hall. It ended at a locked and barred door which
he unfastened with some effort.</p>

<p>“This is the way into the ruins,” he explained.
“You can pass out from them into a path that leads
through the home meadows up to the Moorfield
Farm. It’s a public footpath, and if anyone sees
you they’ll think you’ve been exploring the ruins
from outside.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>Nothing could have suited better with my plans.
I knew the path, and knew that at a certain point
another diverged from it and led through a well-remembered
wood to the barn where I had asked
Violet Bredwardine to meet me.</p>

<p>I passed out into the Castle grounds and clambered
over the crumbling walls and fallen stones till
I found myself on the path. And now every step
became tragical. I was treading on the ashes of the
fire in which two hearts had been scorched and
branded with a mark that could never be effaced.
The grass beside the narrow footway seemed to be
stained with blood. I drew my breath in pain as I
mounted the slope towards the lonely little farm-house
in which I had passed the most glorious and the
most miserable hours of my life. When I came to
the gate into the wood, I stopped and leant upon it
panting, and hardly able to proceed.</p>

<p>The wood was haunted by ghosts more dreadful
to me than any spirits of the dead; the ghosts of
passion and of pain, the ghosts of love and hatred,
of that most terrible of all hatred which is born of
love betrayed.</p>

<p>I shuddered as I thrust open the gate and stepped
beneath the trees. A sombre fir drooped like a weeping
willow over one spot where the way was crossed
by a trickling spring that plunged and disappeared
down a steep gully choked with brambles and dark
ferns. But there was a worse point than that to
pass. A tall beech sent out its roots on to the path,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
and on the smooth rind of its trunk were cut two
initial letters entwined—a V and B. The very
knife that had scored them there lay in my pocket;
I had never parted with it. What madness had
tempted me to blazon our secret to the inquisitive
country-side? I had used one precaution: I had cut
the proclamation of our love on the side of the trunk
that was hidden from the public way. Now, when I
reached the tree, I forced a passage through the
undergrowth to see how time and weather had
dealt with that vain memorial. A bitter shock
awaited me. Every vestige of the monogram had
been destroyed by deep cuts and slashes in the bark.
Only a confused web of scars and scratches marked
the place. The tree’s wounds seemed to reproduce
the wounds upon two hearts.</p>

<p>My head drooped as I dragged myself up the
rest of the ascent, and came out of the wood on the
open hillside. The view was exquisite. The hills
of three fair counties stretched away to the horizon,
and at their feet the silver Wye clasped the rich
cornfields and pastures in its shining arms. But the
whole prospect was darkened over for my eyes by an
invisible cloud. I turned to the spot where, scarcely
a hundred yards away, there rose out of the bracken
the high gray walls of the forsaken barn.</p>

<p>Its desolation seemed symbolical. When it was
built centuries ago the surrounding land had borne
crops worth harvesting instead of the thin grass
and waste of bracken that now surrounded it on all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
sides. Tradition spoke of a time not remote when
the hill swarmed with folk engaged in tilling the
hard soil. Their ruined cottages still lined the lanes
that crept along the crest, and peeped out of the
sheltered nooks. The virgin prairies of the New
World had tempted some of them away; others had
migrated to the mining valleys whose smoke could
almost be seen from where I stood.</p>

<p>So the gray ancient barn stood empty, its wooden
doors dangling helpless from their rusty staples, and
the wind whistling through the narrow slits that
showed like the arrow holes of a Norman keep. I
made my way across the standing bracken that rose
up to my shoulders, and gained the open doorway.
But there was no one within. A solitary sheep started
up from the litter of chaff that strewed the floor, and
bounded out through an opening in the opposite wall,
leaving me alone.</p>

<p>And now I began to repent that I had named
as the meeting-place the spot where we had parted
in such misery those three years ago. I turned with
a pang from the scene, and advanced slowly towards
the brow of the hill. Just below the crest, seated on
a moss-covered stone beside a spring, I found her.</p>

<p>Violet Bredwardine rose and stood where she
was, more like a statue than a living woman. Her
light ringlets, breaking from beneath a quaint straw
helmet, surrounded her face like a halo, and made it
seem more than ever like the face of the child angel
she had seemed to me when I saw her first. Even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
then there had been a wistful look in her innocent
blue eyes, as though the child angel had lost her
way in this troubled earth of ours, and was seeking
pitifully for some escape. And I dreamt—in my
madness I had dreamt—that I could offer her the
help she needed, and change the sadness of her life
into joy.</p>

<p>I strode towards her, all the old, passionate impulses
of the past flooding my heart like wine, and
cried, “Violet!”</p>

<p>She shrank back as if I had struck her and the
soft eyes flashed with anger.</p>

<p>“How dare you! How dare you ask me to
meet you like this?”</p>

<p>I stopped ashamed. In an instant my sudden
emotion was chilled. I felt myself a criminal facing
my judge.</p>

<p>“Forgive me,” I stammered. “I was obliged to
speak to you before you saw Sir Frank Tarleton.
I had to explain to you who he was and what he was
going to ask you.”</p>

<p>She interrupted me with a gesture of scorn. She
pointed to the roof of the barn, just visible over the
crest of the slope from where we stood.</p>

<p>“How dared you ask me to meet you <i>there</i>?
Was there no other place?” Her voice shook.
“How could you be so brutal? To remind me! To
drag me back to the one spot on earth that I was trying
to forget!”</p>

<p>The reproach pierced me like a knife. She was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
right. What was I but a brute? What else is any
man in dealing with the mystery of a woman’s heart—with
those delicate fibres which our rude touch so
often bruises and rends unawares?</p>

<p>I could have thrown myself at her feet and
begged her to trample the life out of me. But there
would have been no reparation in that; there was
none in anything that I could think of doing. It was
a case of least said soonest mended. I had to leave
the wound I had given her to heal itself, and meanwhile
try to render her the only service that was in
my power.</p>

<p>“You can say nothing to me that I don’t deserve,
nothing that is severe enough,” I answered. “I can
only plead that I was distracted by anxiety, on your
account.”</p>

<p>The indignation in her face turned to terror.</p>

<p>“What do you mean? You wrote to me that
I had nothing more to fear.”</p>

<p>“I said, nothing more to fear from Dr. Weathered.
That was all I thought it safe to put in a letter.
And when I wrote it I hoped that I could
protect you from any further trouble. But other
things have happened since. There are complications
in the case that I couldn’t explain without seeing
you, and Sir Frank Tarleton has come down here
to see if you can throw light on them.”</p>

<p>“Sir Frank Tarleton? Who is he?”</p>

<p>“He is the principal medical adviser to the Home
Office. I am his assistant.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>“But I don’t understand!” She stared at me
in natural wonder. “Why should he be mixed up
in it? Have you told him anything?”</p>

<p>“Nothing; you may be assured of that. But
I must tell you what has happened. Weathered
is dead.”</p>

<p>“Dead.” The blue eyes expanded for a moment
in a gleam of relief, almost of exultation. The instant
after they froze dreadfully. “Bertrand! You
killed him!” she whispered.</p>

<p>I shook my head earnestly.</p>

<p>“No. I should have killed him, if there had
been no other way to save you from him. And I
don’t believe any honest man or woman would have
blamed me if I had. But it wasn’t necessary. My
only object was to destroy the record of your confession,
the statement that had placed you in his
power. All I did was to drug him enough to make
him insensible, and take his keys. When I left the
Club at three o’clock in the morning he was still
alive. He was found dead where I left him two
hours afterwards.”</p>

<p>Violet hardly seemed to be listening. Her eyes
were still fixed on me like two blue stones.</p>

<p>“You did it,” she repeated dully. “You killed
him—for my sake!”</p>

<p>Even in the midst of the intense strain those last
three words thrilled me with secret joy. Heaven
forgive me for wishing for an instant that they were
true. I could have brought myself to accept the terrible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
possibility which had been haunting me ever
since the voice of Inspector Charles had told me
through the telephone that Weathered was a corpse,
the possibility that I had administered a fatal dose.
But I saw that Violet was on the verge of breaking
down. For her sake, far more than for my own, I
must banish that theory from the field.</p>

<p>“No,” I assured her again. “That is out of the
question. Sir Frank Tarleton is the greatest living
authority on poisons, and he has been engaged for
the last three days in trying to ascertain the cause of
death. I have been by his side the whole time, assisting
him, and I know that his suspicions point in
another direction altogether.”</p>

<p>I broke off to catch her in my arms as she swayed
forward. I was just in time. I laid her gently on
the moss and sprinkled her face with water from
the spring, the sweet face that I would have given
all I possessed to sprinkle with kisses instead.
Luckily the collapse was only momentary. While I
was still bending over her she opened her lips to say,
“Go on. Tell me everything.”</p>

<p>I waited till she had recovered strength enough
to sit up. It would have done harm to wait longer.
It was necessary for her to know exactly how matters
stood.</p>

<p>“Dr. Weathered had other victims beside you,
and other enemies beside me. The police are on the
trail of some of them and Sir Frank has obtained an
important clue which may lead us to the true cause<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
of death. But meanwhile notice has been attracted
to the costume in which I went to the Domino Club
that night.”</p>

<p>Violet began to look frightened.</p>

<p>“The one I lent you?—you ought to have destroyed
it!” she said excitedly.</p>

<p>“It is very fortunate I didn’t,” I returned soothingly.
“It has come out that it was the costume
you generally wore; and you remember that was why
you lent it to me, so that Weathered should think I
was you. Anyhow, it has been traced to you, and
if you couldn’t produce it you would be called on to
account for its disappearance. Do you see that?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I see that. But surely if they know the
costume was mine they must believe that I was there
that night. My God, do they suspect me of the
murder?”</p>

<p>I was agonized by her terror.</p>

<p>“They know you to be innocent. Your innocence
has been proved,” I cried out fiercely. “You have
what the law calls an alibi; you were more than a
hundred miles away when the crime was committed—if
there was a crime. Good heavens, Violet, can
you believe that I shouldn’t have given myself up
to justice the very moment it was necessary to
clear you?”</p>

<p>Her expression softened more than I could have
hoped.</p>

<p>“I know that, Bertrand,” she said in a low voice.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
“Only I don’t understand why you are here. What
does Sir Frank Tarleton want with me?”</p>

<p>“He wanted two things. One was to make sure
that you really were here on Wednesday night. He
is now quite satisfied of that. The other is to ask
you if you can explain something that has puzzled us
in Weathered’s appointment-book. Whenever your
name appears it is followed by a number, and we
don’t know why.”</p>

<p>Violet lowered her eyes with a frown.</p>

<p>“He gave me that number to sign my letters by
when I wrote to him. He told me that it would
help me to write more freely if I used a number instead
of a name.”</p>

<p>I started in alarm. “But why should you need
that? What were the letters about?”</p>

<p>The poor girl’s eyes still refused to meet mine.</p>

<p>“He made me tell him the whole story in letters.
He said that was the only way to get it off my
mind.”</p>

<p>I clenched my teeth together to keep myself from
uttering a word. The doctor’s safe had been opened
and his case-book destroyed uselessly.</p>

PSYCHO-ANALYSIS</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It was</span> one of those moments in which life seems
to cast away the mask of convention and spring upon
us like a giant fanged and armed for our destruction;
one of those moments in which the bravest heart
quails and the strongest hope withers to despair.</p>

<p>My crime had been committed for nothing.
Whether the death of that despicable villain lay at
my door or not, I did not know, and it hardly seemed
to matter any longer. Somewhere there was still in
existence the weapon with which he had terrorized
his unhappy victim, and I could not tell in what
hands, nor when it might be employed to ruin her
and me together.</p>

<p>Weathered’s cunning scheme stood revealed in
its full atrocity. His patients had been divided into
two classes. Those who had nothing serious on their
consciences, and those whom it was not worth his
while to blackmail received the ordinary treatment
given to nervous patients by respectable physicians.
Those who came to him to be cured of vicious propensities,
on the other hand, were encouraged to
indulge them under his eye, under the pretence that
they would thus be gradually overcome; and those
who sought relief from evil memories were bidden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
to rid their mind of its secret burden in correspondence
which could be preserved for future use.</p>

<p>So far as I could judge he had fallen into those
evil courses by degrees. Sarah Neobard’s defence
of her step-father might not be far from the truth.
I thought it likely that such a man as Weathered,
with no strong principle to keep him straight, might
naturally have deteriorated under the influence of his
patients. All the precautions with which the confessional
is surrounded in Catholic churches were
wanting in this case. The doctor was probably a
man without any religious feeling, and without any
real scruples on the subject of morality. Instead
of curing his patients he had let himself become
infected with their disease. The confessions he had
listened to had inflamed his own imagination, and
made evil familiar to his thoughts. In the end he
had come to take a fiendish pleasure in gloating over
tales of guilty indulgence and innocence betrayed.
He had delighted in the analysis of women’s hearts;
he had learned to play upon their sensitive natures
like instruments, and draw the notes of passion and
pain. The devils in hell must soothe their own torments
with such music.</p>

<p>It was torture enough for me to think of my own
tragedy, as well as Violet’s, profaned by the coarse
curiosity of a blackmailer. If I had sinned—and I
never could admit that she had sinned at all—if I
had sinned, at least I had not done so wilfully and
basely, but swept away on the overpowering flood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
of that tremendous impulse by which all the planets
move in heaven, and all the earth is wrapped in her
green garment, and all the birds burst into song, and
all the race of man is renewed for ever.</p>

<p>Our sad romance began in the purest innocence.
I did not know of her existence on that morning
when I set out with a knapsack on my back to explore
the old borderland of England and Wales. I had
formed no fixed plans; I meant to walk where fancy
took me, and stop when I felt inclined; and the last
thing I expected was that I should pass all my holiday
on one spot. It was not till I reached the village
that I heard of the ruins that lay hidden at the
back of the Earl of Ledbury’s stately seat, and was
persuaded to turn aside and see them.</p>

<p>I was told that a footpath leading from the
churchyard up the hill would bring me past them,
and, as far as I could make out, his lordship had laid
down no absolute rule against strangers going over
them. I was young and irresponsible enough to take
the risk of being turned out as a trespasser. I
climbed over a gate padlocked and fortified with
barbed wire, crossed a meadow, and passed through a
gap in the outer wall. I had spent half an hour in
scrambling over heaps of fallen masonry, and was
just beginning to descend a broken stairway up which
I had climbed for the sake of the view, when I saw
standing on the grass near its foot the loveliest girl
I had ever seen.</p>

<p>She was watching me with the shy wonder of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
child, and I came down slowly, scarcely daring to
breathe, lest she should turn and run away. But no
such thought was in her head. I seemed to her a
boy, very little older than herself, and it turned out
that she had come to take me under her protection.</p>

<p>When I lifted my cap, and expressed a hope that
I wasn’t trespassing, she gave me a cordial smile of
a comrade in mischief.</p>

<p>“Yes, you are trespassing,” she said frankly,
“but they won’t take any notice if they see me speaking
to you. I saw you from my window and I came
to prevent any of the servants driving you away.”</p>

<p>I hardly knew which was more delicious, the
simplicity or the friendliness of the child angel, as
she was named already in my thoughts. That night
I heard her story from the good mistress of the
farm. She had lost her mother as soon as she was
born, and, as sometimes happens, she had lost her
place in her father’s heart in consequence. He was
then a middle-aged man, his wife had been the only
woman he had ever cared for, and she had borne him
no other child. Life for him was closed. He resigned
himself to let the earldom and the encumbered
estate pass to his brother, and shut himself up with
his grief in the one habitable corner of his desolate
house.</p>

<p>Of Violet he took no more notice than he could
help. His sense of duty bade him engage a strict
governess, and direct that his daughter should be
brought up to marry money, since he could leave her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
none. The governess conceived that the way to attain
this end was to keep the girl in absolute seclusion
till a suitable bridegroom was found, and then to
thrust her into his arms. The result was that her
life had actually been very much like that of a
princess in a fairy tale who is immured in a tower
and kept from the sight of men. And I had been
cast unconsciously for the part of the fairy hero who
scales the tower and wins the maiden’s heart.</p>

<p>In the first confusion of the meeting I was far
more tongue-tied than she. I guessed, of course, that
she must be the daughter of Lord Ledbury, and this
was the first time I had ever spoken to anyone of
her rank. I was in doubt whether to address her with
the word ladyship. I think the awe with which her
rank inspired me had a great deal to do with what
followed. It lifted her so far above me in my own
mind, that I was blind to her growing love, and at
first mistook my own love for the devotion of a vassal
to his queen.</p>

<p>She talked to me about the ruins, holding me
there spell-bound till neither of us could find more
to say. At last, when I felt obliged to come away,
she asked me wistfully where I was going. And I,
who had made up my mind already not to go, if I
could find any excuse for staying in the neighbourhood,
with any chance of meeting her again, answered
vaguely that I didn’t know. I was looking,
I told her, for some place where I could put up.</p>

<p>Her whole face brightened when I said that, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
she cried eagerly, “There is a farm-house on the
hill where they take visitors in the summer, and I
don’t think they have anyone yet. I often go past it
in my walks, and I haven’t seen any strangers about.”</p>

<p>My heart exulted within me. There was to be
no walking tour for me that summer. When one
has come within the gates of Paradise how can he
want to wander more?</p>

<p>And so I took off my knapsack in the honeysuckle
porch of the little farm-house, and stayed on.
It chanced for our undoing that the strict governess
had gone away for her own holiday a day or two
before I came, and did not return till it was time
for me to exile myself from Eden. Violet was left
alone. No callers had come to the Castle for many
years. There were no neighbours in her own station
of life within many miles. The clergyman was an
old bachelor interested only in butterflies and moths,
of which he had a wonderful collection, and blind
to everything that went on in his parish. If our
romance was watched, and I have no doubt that it
was watched by many curious eyes unknown to us,
none of the watchers dared to carry tales of his
daughter to the Earl of Ledbury. Violet saw her
father twice a day at meals, and he never dreamed of
asking her how she spent her time between.</p>

<p>The golden month rolled by. The first few days
each of us made believe that our meetings were accidental.
But soon we ceased to pretend that it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
chance that had led her steps up the hill and led mine
down them to the wood in which we came together.
We explored the hills in company, rousing the partridges
from the corn and rabbits from the fern.
The wood-pigeons cooed and wheeled above our
heads; the robins peeped at us from the hedges and
the squirrels from the trees. We stood beside the
lonely cromlech named after the mythical hero who
held the Saxon hosts at bay, and we looked down
into the Golden Valley and saw the peaks of the
Welsh mountains far away. And we were happy....</p>

<p>Lightly, O lightly, broke upon me the knowledge
that she loved me. What I had never hoped for had
come to pass. I had been content to worship her in
silence. Endymion might so have worshipped Artemis
if he had been the first to see her. Bottom, the
weaver, might so have worshipped Titania if the
magic juice had touched his eyelids before hers. She
had been as unapproachable in my eyes as any inhabitant
of the moonlit world of sleep. It was with
almost a pang, with a strange shrinking of the heart,
that I first perceived that she was mortal like myself,
and that I had awakened her. I seemed to have
broken into a temple and profaned the shrine.</p>

<p>I do not recollect that we said anything. One
day when we were walking side by side along a
sunken lane that led to a little waterfall I stooped
suddenly and kissed her.</p>

<p>From that day we were sweethearts as openly as
any rustic pair. To her it was all as natural as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
romances she had read, and she can never have had
the least suspicion of the misgivings that had vexed
my soul. She seemed surprised even when I touched
on the social gulf that separated us. She owned sorrowfully
that her father would never hear of such
a match, but she evidently took it for granted that I
should not heed his opposition. I was her knight,
and it was for me to overcome every obstacle in the
way. Her faith in me was perfect. All affection
for her father had been crushed out of her in childhood.
She had loved me more easily, and she loved
me more passionately, because she had no one else
to love.</p>

<p>And what were we to do? I was barely of age.
I was not qualified; I had no means of support except
a dwindling legacy that would be exhausted by
the time I was able to earn my first fee. The knights
of old seem never to have been troubled by such
hindrances as these; the dragons they vanquished
were creatures who could be subdued by strength of
arm; they never had to ride into anything worse than
an ogre’s castle or a wizard’s cave. The terrors of
the bank parlour and the house-agent’s office were
unknown to them; and they never had to face a baker
or a butcher armed with his weekly bill.</p>

<p>I put off as long as I could the pain of confessing
to Violet that these dragons in the way must take
years to vanquish. And at first she hardly grasped
what it would mean to her. The mere waiting, I
could see, would cost her less than me. After all,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
courtship is the supreme time of womanhood. Then
she is queen indeed, and marriage is for her dethronement.
Her bridal is like the glorious pyre on
which the Hindu widow once expired in religious
ecstasy. It was not until she realized that I was
going that Violet broke down.</p>

<p>There the burden was shifted to the other side.
Delay is the suffering of man, separation the suffering
of woman. I had my work to go back to; I
had my friends and all the distractions of life in
London. She had nothing before her but her remote
and solitary prison.</p>

<p>We had fallen into the way of meeting most
often in the deserted barn. Its situation assured us
of a privacy more secure than that of the lanes and
woods. No one could approach us without being
seen, and no one ever did approach. No one could
see through the openings—a bare two inches wide
in the thick wall; and no one could overhear. A pile
of bracken made our seat, and there we rested many
a long summer afternoon, the battered door thrown
wide to let us count the windings of the river far
below, while we talked of all the coming years
might bring.</p>

<p>So it was there we met on that last afternoon to
say good-bye. We had put off till the last moment
any consideration of what was to happen next. We
had made no plans to meet again. I did not even
know that Lord Ledbury had a house in London, to
which Violet was taken at rare intervals, when it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
happened to be without a tenant, but always under
strict guard and more for business than for pleasure.
We had not even discussed any plans for correspondence,
though it was evident that I could not write
to her at her father’s house without everything coming
out. It was understood between us that my very
existence must be kept secret if it were possible.
Beyond that we had not found courage to face the
situation.</p>

<p>And now we had to face it at last, and it was
too much for us to bear. It seemed to both of us
like death. It was idle to think that we could part
like that, uncertain if ever we should meet again.
It was a waste of breath to pronounce the word
good-bye when we were clinging to each other in
the desperation of young life in travail with its destiny.
I dare not try to recall that agony.... I
stole across with the footstep of a felon and closed
the battered door.</p>

<p>When I had slain my love I understood too late
what I had done. Her anguish was a revelation to
me of what her utter purity had been. We passed
out from that brief frenzy into a strange world. The
sun had fallen from our sky, and Joshua could not
have called it back again. We were two spectres
in each other’s sight. I did not ask her to forgive
me—I could not forgive myself. Rather would I
have begged her to reproach me. But no such
thought was in her mind. Her whole feeling was
one of horror at what she had destroyed in herself;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
and I was only hateful to her as the mirror in which
she had seen her unknown self. She moved her
lips to implore me never to let her see me again.
She shuddered past me, and went down the hill with
the stumbling gait of a wounded bird.</p>

<p>I know there are some men, and there may be
some women, who will think that I was a fool to
let her go. They will tell me that I ought not to
have taken her at her word; that if I had waited, in
a short time she would have recovered, and the
breach might have been patched up, and the wound
healed. I cannot tell if they are right; I only know
that I obeyed her, and fled from her neighbourhood
with no hope of ever coming back.</p>

<p>And so the lonely girl, left to herself with no one
to confide in, brooded over her secret till it became
like a viper gnawing at her heart. How she came
to hear of the charlatan she had not told me. Somehow
or other during one of her stays in her father’s
house in town, the news reached her of the new
science of psycho-analysis, and of the practitioner
who undertook to do what Macbeth longed for in
vain, to pluck from memory a rooted sorrow, and
erase the writing from the tablets of the brain.</p>

<p>She went to him, of course, without consulting
those about her, and from that moment she became
his helpless prey. What arts he used to beguile her
it is easy to guess. At first she believed in him, and
when her suspicion began to be aroused she was already
in his power, and dared not break with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>By this time the Earl of Ledbury and the duenna
had put their heads together and decided that Lady
Violet must pass a season in London, and be seen in
the great world. In consequence she had much
more liberty. She made some girl friends whom she
was allowed to go about with, and among them were
not a few who held modern notions on the rights of
girlhood, and were ready to encourage and to screen
her in the courses into which she was compelled by
her taskmaster. Her most intimate comrade willingly
became a member of the Domino Club.</p>

<p>But not even to her most intimate friend dared
Violet disclose the true situation. While she still
trusted in Weathered and believed in his power to
heal her soul of sin, she had written the whole story
of our love in letters which the scoundrel now refused
to give up, except as the price of a far worse
surrender. There was only one being in the world
whom she could appeal to without the risk of further
shame. And thus we met again.</p>

<p>The medical directory gave her my address, and
she wrote to me at Sir Frank Tarleton’s. But her
letter begged for a strictly private interview in such
urgent language that I thought it safer not to let her
come there. I asked her to meet me at the corner
of Shaftesbury Avenue, as though by accident, and
I took her to the little room which I could call
my own.</p>

<p>Nearly four years had gone by since our tragic
parting, but when we stood face to face again they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
did not seem four hours. Violet’s face changed
from red to white and back again as she half held
out a trembling hand and dropped it woefully; and
my hand trembled too as I raised it to my hat. I
thought it best to say nothing except the few words
necessary to explain where we were going, and she
seemed glad to keep silent till we were safely there.</p>

<p>The story she had to tell was so appalling, and
the effort of telling it cost her so much, that naturally
a good deal was left out. Certainly I quite
failed to gather from her that Weathered had induced
her to make her confession to him in letters.
I supposed that he had taken it down from her lips.
It is the familiar practice of West End consultants,
who see their patients at long intervals, to make a
careful entry of all the particulars of the case for
future reference; and I supposed that Weathered
had taken advantage of this to make a damning record
in his case-book, which would be quite sufficient
to enable him to blast his victims’ reputation, although
it might not be evidence in a lawyer’s eyes.</p>

<p>The truth is that I was myself too agitated to
go into the matter carefully even if Violet had been
in a state to be cross-examined. The whole interview
resolved itself into a series of wild outbreaks
on her part, and attempts to assure her on mine.
Indeed, I hardly know that we arrived at any clear
understanding of what she was asking of me, or
what I was promising her. The one thing clear to
me was that the only way to save her would be for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
me to get at the doctor’s case-book and destroy it.
And to do that I must obtain his keys.</p>

<p>What Violet had told me about the Domino Club
and their meetings in that accursed place gave me
my plan. I would do what I could not ask her to
do. All that was necessary was that I should be
able to approach Weathered without putting him on
his guard. I must disguise myself in a costume with
which he was familiar, one which would allure him,
and in which I could play the part of the sought
rather than the seeker. And so the fatally easy plot
took shape.</p>

<p>There was barely an inch between Violet and me
in height, and that inch would be concealed by the
Zenobia helmet. It would not be too difficult for me
to imitate for an hour or two the lighter movements
of a woman. Weathered would be quite unsuspicious;
the dress, the artificial light, the noise and
excitement of the revel would all be in my favour.
The doctor, I gathered, drank freely on these occasions;
I had only to wait till the night was advanced
and the wine had done its work.</p>

<p>I told the distressed girl as little as possible of
what I meant to do, or to attempt. I said merely
that I must meet Weathered, and that it would be
the best way for me to impersonate her for one night.
She consented readily enough—what else could she
do? She told me the date of the next dance, and
undertook to send the mask and costume to my room
some days beforehand, so that I should have time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
to see that it fitted, and to practice moving about
with it on.</p>

<p>We did not bid each other any formal farewell.
Nothing was said about our next meeting, indeed
I felt no confidence that there would be another. She
had been driven to appeal to me in her extremity,
but she showed no sign of having forgiven me.
Rather she seemed to find every moment painful
that she passed with me. All the time she was struggling
with herself, trying to speak to me as if I were
a stranger whom she found herself obliged to trust,
but continually faltering and letting her voice die
down to a broken whisper.</p>

<p>When I had let her out at the street door she
hurried away blindly like an escaping prisoner. And
as soon as she was out of sight I hastened round to
Montague Street, and locked myself up in Tarleton’s
arsenal of poisons.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br>

THE EARL OF LEDBURY INTERVENES</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My first</span> thought, when I knew that Violet’s
confession was still undestroyed, was to hide the fact
from her. I must spare her the torturing apprehensions
that I felt myself. Fortunately she did not
seem to be thinking of her own danger; at all events,
she put no questions to me about the letters. Perhaps
she took it for granted that I had secured them,
or that they were no longer in existence. At all
events, the possibility that they might be in other
hands as dangerous as Weathered’s did not seem
to strike her at the moment. The idea that I had
murdered Weathered overpowered all her faculties.</p>

<p>Again and again I went over with her all that
had happened.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe that I killed him,” I told her
with the utmost earnestness. “Surely you can trust
me to know what I was doing. I am not an ordinary
doctor. I have made a special study of poisons, as
the pupil, I may say the favourite pupil, of the greatest
expert alive. I am prepared to swear to you or in
any court of justice that the dose I gave him would
not have killed any man in a normal condition of
health. Sir Frank Tarleton and I both observed
symptoms that point to some other drug having been
administered to Weathered. Remember that you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
were not his only patient, and you are not likely to
have been the only one whose confidence he abused.
The Domino Club probably swarmed with his enemies,
in fact the manageress as good as told us so.
His own step-daughter asserts that there were other
women with whom he had mysterious relations——”</p>

<p>“Other women!” She interrupted me with a
cry of dismay. “Do you mean—does she know anything
about me?”</p>

<p>I recollected Sarah Neobard’s fierce denunciation,
and the scene she had described, when she sat
with her hired spy in the restaurant watching the
persecuted girl. I tried to explain away my unlucky
slip.</p>

<p>“No, no; I didn’t mean that for a moment.
She told us that her step-father had dealings with
some of his women patients, and one of the waiters
in the Club described some women who were there
that night. He described me among others; that
is to say, he described the costume I was wearing.
But he suspected that it was worn by a man. He
must have keen eyes.”</p>

<p>“Then you are under suspicion!” Her anxiety
was instantly diverted from herself to me again.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” I answered. “No one has the least
suspicion who the wearer of the costume really was.
The police made inquiries, and all they learned was
that a similar costume had been supplied to you a
year ago. They followed up the clue, and found that
you were down here on the night, so that it must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
have been someone else in the Club. Now you see
why I sent it back to you. If Sir Frank Tarleton
says anything about it, all you have to do is to say
that you remember having such a costume, and offer
to find it and show it to him. He and the police will
naturally believe that the one worn at the Club that
night was a duplicate.”</p>

<p>Violet looked a little uncertain, as she had some
excuse for being. I thought I might venture now to
ask her to come back to the house to meet my formidable
chief.</p>

<p>“Sir Frank will be there by the time that we get
down,” I said. “He has gone for an hour’s stroll
in the park.”</p>

<p>She put her hand to her head as she stood up and
prepared to come with me.</p>

<p>“Will he ask me anything else? What were
you going to tell me just now?”</p>

<p>“The numbers,” I reminded her. “He will ask
you if you know what they meant.”</p>

<p>“Ah! Must I tell him that? Must he know
about the letters? Will everything come out?—O
Bertrand!”</p>

<p>Her gasp of anguish wrung my very heart-strings.</p>

<p>“No!” I cried. “Don’t give way to such
thoughts. You don’t know Tarleton. He is the soul
of honour. He is delicacy itself. He won’t ask you
one word more than he can help. You need tell him
nothing more than that Weathered gave you a number<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
to use in writing to him. You can trust Sir
Frank not to ask you what the letters were about.”</p>

<p>“But he will know—he will know!” she sighed
despairingly. And I could say little in reply.</p>

<p>We found the door unlocked that led from the
house into the ruins, and we parted in the corridor,
Violet going upstairs to her room while I made my
way back to the library into which I had been shown
at first. Waiting for me outside the door I found
my friendly manservant.</p>

<p>“You’ll find the other gentleman inside,” he
whispered. “He’s been back about five minutes.”</p>

<p>I went in trying to look unconcerned, and found
Tarleton comfortably seated in an armchair engaged
in the familiar rite of waving his mascot to
and fro as if it were a censer with which he was
offering invisible incense to the Sphinx.</p>

<p>“I hope I haven’t kept you waiting, sir. I have
been taking a look at the ruins of the old Castle.”</p>

<p>“I have had a look at them, too,” was the enigmatic
answer. “Twelfth century, I should think.
One of the first castles put up by the Normans when
they began penetrating South Wales.”</p>

<p>I could only hope that that was the extent of his
observations. I could not bring myself to ask.</p>

<p>There was silence between us till Violet came
into the room. The change in her amazed me. She
was rather pale but perfectly composed. Her manner
was full of courteous dignity. It was the first
time that I had seen her as the Lady Violet Bredwardine,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
the daughter of a noble house, conscious
of her claims to deference from strangers.</p>

<p>The consultant rose from his seat with every
mark of respect and consideration, and I clumsily
imitated him. She was the first to speak.</p>

<p>“Sir Frank Tarleton?—I am told that you wish
to see me on urgent business. I am sorry that you
have been kept waiting, but I had gone out for a walk.
Won’t you sit down?”</p>

<p>She included me in the invitation by a slight,
distant bow, as she seated herself facing us.</p>

<p>“It is very good of you to see me, Lady Violet.—Dr.
Cassilis is my assistant.” Another distant
bow. “I have been called in as a physician in the
case of another medical man who had the honour
to include you among his patients, I believe—Dr.
Weathered.”</p>

<p>A bow in the affirmative, still colder, if possible.</p>

<p>“I regret to have to inform you that Dr. Weathered
has died—of heart failure.”</p>

<p>A little gasp, natural enough in the circumstances.
A gasp of relief in my ears, relief at hearing
the death described as natural. A gasp of surprise,
I could only hope, in the keen ears of my chief.</p>

<p>“Dr. Weathered’s death was rather sudden. It
is desirable for the sake of his family to dispense
with an inquest if possible, but it has been necessary
to make some inquiries into his affairs, and I
have had to go through his appointment-book, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
book in which he entered the names of his patients
who came to see him, you understand.”</p>

<p>“I understand.” Just a tremor, immediately
subdued.</p>

<p>“Naturally your name appears in the book among
others. And it happens to be one of several that
have numbers attached to them, as if for purposes
of identification. If you know, or can suggest, the
reason for that, I shall be very much obliged by your
telling me.”</p>

<p>Violet straightened herself up and spoke very
distinctly. It was clear to me that she had prepared
her answer carefully.</p>

<p>“I can tell you exactly. When Dr. Weathered’s
patients had to write to him about whatever he was
treating them for, he gave them a number to use
instead of their own names. The letters were confidential.”</p>

<p>Tarleton’s face told me that he had grasped the
full situation, as I had grasped it half an hour before.
He looked at me instead of her, but he failed
to hide his consternation altogether.</p>

<p>“What is the matter? Why do you look like
that?” the startled girl exclaimed.</p>

<p>The specialist pulled himself together.</p>

<p>“There is nothing the matter, Lady Violet. I
was staggered for a moment at the thought of what
might have happened if I hadn’t taken the precaution
of coming here and questioning you. I will see
that this correspondence is destroyed unread as soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
as I get back to town. Unless, that is, it has been
destroyed already. Dr. Weathered may have burnt
the letters as soon as he had read them.”</p>

<p>The explanation was not very happy. Poor Violet’s
dignity forsook her as she realized for the first
time that the outpouring of her heart, the record of
her secret shame, were at the mercy of whatever
stranger first gained access to the dead man’s repository.
She did her best to keep her eyes from
straying in my direction, but the half turn of her
head towards me before she spoke to Tarleton was
enough to tell me what she felt.</p>

<p>“Do you mean,” she faltered, “that there is a
danger of someone finding these letters?—someone
who might make use of them?”</p>

<p>I had not often seen my chief at a loss, but he
was plainly put out now.</p>

<p>“My dear young lady, there isn’t the least fear
of that. It may ease your mind if I tell you more
than I intended. Dr. Weathered’s death occurred
in a club in Chelsea, and the proprietress or manager,
whichever she really is, sent for the police. They
thought the death might be due to foul play, and
they have been making some inquiries. Meanwhile,
they have had their eyes on everyone who would be
at all likely to have anything to do with the case,
and you may be sure that if the doctor left any secret
correspondence it will be secured and burnt immediately.”</p>

<p>Violet had glanced at my face while he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
speaking, and had read in it, no doubt, that it would
be her best course to appear satisfied. She murmured
a “Thank you.”</p>

<p>“There is one other question I should like to ask
you, but I hope you won’t think it concerns you
personally. The doctor’s death took place on Wednesday
night, and as you were more than a hundred
miles away, no one supposes that you can throw
any light on what took place in the Club that night.”</p>

<p>He paused for a moment, as if to give her a
chance of asking how he came to know that she was
so far away. But of course I had already given her
the information, and she was afraid to speak.</p>

<p>“But it seems that you have a double, or rather
that someone was impersonating you that night. The
attention of the police was drawn to the presence
of a dancer wearing a fancy dress which the costumiers
consider to represent Zenobia, the famous
Queen of Palmyra who fought against the Romans
in the third century. They made inquiries, and heard
that a similar costume had been supplied to you about
a year ago.—Can you tell me what has become
of it?”</p>

<p>The final question was put abruptly. It was
well that Violet had been prepared for it. She kept
perfectly cool; if anything, too cool. I should have
liked her to show a little more disturbance.</p>

<p>“I have no idea. I suppose my maid has put it
away somewhere among my things. But I will ring
for her, and ask.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>“Permit me, Lady Violet.” Tarleton sprang to
the bell before she was out of her chair. It was
answered by the manservant, whom her ladyship dispatched
in quest of her maid.</p>

<p>I watched my chief while we were waiting. I
flattered myself that I had outmanœuvred him in
this direction. His lowered brows told me that he
was puzzled. He must have come down to Tyberton
expecting to find the costume missing, and to receive
some made-up story to account for its disappearance.</p>

<p>A woman came into the room, an elderly person,
of very plain appearance, whom I put down as Lord
Ledbury’s housekeeper. I didn’t think his lordship’s
means were sufficient to provide his daughter
with a lady’s maid.</p>

<p>“Oh, Henderson, do you know what has become
of that fancy dress of mine with the helmet and
breastplate? Can you put your hands on it?”</p>

<p>Henderson showed no surprise.</p>

<p>“Certainly, my lady. It is in the drawer at the
bottom of your ladyship’s wardrobe.”</p>

<p>“Just go and fetch it, will you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my lady.”</p>

<p>She went out with the movement of a well-drilled
actor, leaving me with the uncomfortable
impression that the scene had been rehearsed, and
that Tarleton could hardly miss coming to the same
conclusion. He muttered some vague expression of
regret for the trouble he was giving to Lady Violet,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
and then sat with his lips pursed up in rather ominous
fashion, and his eyes fixed on the door.</p>

<p>Henderson reappeared rather too quickly. She
carried all the articles that made up the much-talked-of
costume, the paste-board armour coated with silver
paint, the flowing shirt, even the sandals which
the Wardour Street Israelite had deemed appropriate
footwear for a desert queen.</p>

<p>Tarleton gave them the barest glance, as they
were spread out on the table, and bowed to Violet.</p>

<p>“I have to thank your ladyship.”</p>

<p>He was in the act of rising when the door of the
room was thrown open abruptly.</p>

<p>The figure on the threshold presented the appearance
of a man just roused from sleep and inclined
to resent the interruption of his dreams. He was
tall and thin, and seemed to hold himself upright
with an effort. His gray hairs straggled over his
head in unbrushed disorder, and his clothes hung on
him as though they had been dropped where they
were in a fit of absence of mind. In spite of these
signs of neglect there was an air of dignity about him
that left me in no doubt as to his identity.</p>

<p>The Earl of Ledbury advanced into the room,
turning a glance of disapproval from Sir Frank
Tarleton to myself, and addressed his daughter.</p>

<p>“Violet, what business have you with these
gentlemen?”</p>

<p>What excuse she would have made if it had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
left to her to answer, I don’t know. Tarleton instantly
took the burden on himself.</p>

<p>“My business with Lady Violet is official, my
lord. I am right, no doubt, in thinking that you
are the Earl of Ledbury?”</p>

<p>“Official?” The word sounded like a snarl.
“Who are you, sir?”</p>

<p>“I am the principal medical adviser to the Home
Office. My name is Sir Frank Tarleton, and this
gentleman is my assistant, Dr. Cassilis.”</p>

<p>I was already on my feet. I gave the Earl a
deferential bow which only seemed to increase his
irritation.</p>

<p>“And may I ask what you mean, gentlemen, by
coming into my house and interviewing my daughter
behind my back?”</p>

<p>Tarleton was not the man to let himself be addressed
in that fashion.</p>

<p>“I think you forget yourself, my lord. The
Lady Violet is of age, I believe. We are here in the
discharge of our duty, and I need not remind your
lordship that the law is not a respecter of persons.”</p>

<p>Lord Ledbury’s look of anger changed to one
of amazement and alarm.</p>

<p>“Good heavens, what do you mean, sir? What
has the law to do with Lady Violet Bredwardine?”</p>

<p>“Very little, I hope, but it was necessary for us
to see her ladyship and put a few questions to her,
for her own sake.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>The Earl turned suddenly. “Henderson, leave
the room.”</p>

<p>“One moment, please.” The physician detained
the woman by a gesture. “Can you tell me if this
costume has been where you just found it during the
whole of last week? Would it have been possible
for anyone to take it without your knowledge, send
it away, and put it back again afterwards?”</p>

<p>It was a fatal question, the one question I ought
to have anticipated and prepared for. Violet’s face
must have betrayed her to a duller eye than my
shrewd chief’s. As for Henderson, she gazed
stupidly at her mistress in the evident need of
prompting.</p>

<p>The irascible father could see this as plainly as
ourselves.</p>

<p>“The truth, woman!” he thundered. “Tell the
truth this instant.”</p>

<p>Henderson turned very red.</p>

<p>“I had no wish to tell anything else, my lord.
The drawer wasn’t locked, that’s all I can say. I
can’t tell whether anyone might have taken the costume
out and put it back again, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. That is all I have to ask of you
at present.” Nothing in Tarleton’s tone or look
showed what amount of importance he attached to
the answer he had received; and the woman, after
gazing uneasily round at us all in turn, went out of
the room with a subdued mien.</p>

<p>What the effect was on me, I need scarcely say.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
The whole question of Violet’s connection with the
case had been reopened. If the astute investigator
chose to follow up the clue he would not find it difficult
to obtain evidence through the post office that
a parcel large enough to contain the incriminating
costume had been received by Lady Violet since the
discovery of the crime. It might not be possible to
trace it to me as the sender, but she might be placed
in such a position that only a full confession on
my part could clear her. That confession, of course,
I had been ready to make all along, the moment it
could do her the least service. My difficulty had
been to make it without involving her as what the
law calls an accessory before the fact. How could
my chief, how could Inspector Charles, fail to draw
the inference that we had acted in collusion, and
that she had lent me her disguise knowing the use
I meant to make of it?</p>

<p>The torturing problem racked my brain the whole
time that Sir Frank was explaining the situation to
Lord Ledbury. The explanation was a painful one.
He did his best to soften the ugliest features, but it
could not be concealed that Lady Violet had consulted
a doctor without the knowledge of her father
or her chaperon, that the doctor had died in suspicious
circumstances, and that some suspicion had
attached to the wearer of a fancy dress similar to
the one spread out before us.</p>

<p>The shock would have been a terrible one for any
father. It must have been doubly so for a man who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
had lived for so many years out of the world, ignoring
the changes that had come about since his youth.
The whole story must have taken him out of his
bearings. The society in which night clubs flourish,
and girls as young as Violet are found in them, was
as strange to him as it would have been to any parent
of the Victorian age.</p>

<p>I could see his mood turning from surprise and
bewilderment into growing fury as he listened. And
his anger was no longer directed against Tarleton
and myself.</p>

<p>“It comes to this, that my daughter’s name is
mixed up with a murder case,” he exploded at last.
“If she is not actually under suspicion her clothes
are. Violet!” The stricken girl turned beseeching
eyes on him. “Unless you can assure me that you
had no more to do with this business than I had, you
shan’t pass another night under this roof.”</p>

<p>The injustice of it nearly stung me into speech.
The Earl had done nothing to deserve his daughter’s
confidence. He had let her grow up a stranger to
him. He had handed her over to a mercenary with
no qualifications beyond those of a drill-sergeant or
a prison warder. And he was ablaze with wrath
because she had grown into a living creature with
blood in her veins, instead of a wooden doll.</p>

<p>Violet’s eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p>“What do you want me to say?” she implored.
“I didn’t even know that Dr. Weathered was dead
till these gentlemen told me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>“You knew him, it seems. What did you go to
him for? You haven’t been ill.”</p>

<p>I began to feel anxious for myself as well as her.
But she replied with unexpected spirit.</p>

<p>“I went to him as a doctor. He was a nerve
specialist, and I went to him about my nerves.”</p>

<p>“Nerves!” His lordship spat out the word in
scorn. “A girl of your age has no business with
nerves. Did you tell Miss Pollexfen that you were
suffering from nerves?”</p>

<p>“No.” Violet flared up with a touch of her
father. “Why should I? Miss Pollexfen is no
friend of mine. I didn’t choose her for a companion.
I am old enough to decide for myself whether I
want to see a doctor, without consulting her.”</p>

<p>Lord Ledbury was clearly taken aback. He can
have had no real suspicion that his daughter had
done anything seriously wrong, or he would hardly
have cross-examined her before us. Little as he loved
her, regard for his own good name would have made
him refrain from going on.</p>

<p>“So you consider yourself independent, do
you?” He pointed to the clothes. “Have you lent
these things—to anyone?”</p>

<p>I held my breath. I dared not make the least
sign to Violet. And if I had, she would not have
seen it. She kept her eyes steadily fixed on her
father’s.</p>

<p>“Yes.” It was the wisest answer to give now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
that so much had come out. A falsehood must have
been detected in a few hours.</p>

<p>“Tell me her name.”</p>

<p>My heart seemed to stop beating. There was a
tense pause in which the air of the room vibrated
with suspense. Then the girl slowly shook her head.</p>

<p>“I cannot.”</p>

<p>“You mean you won’t. I command you, Violet.
Do you hear?”</p>

<p>Her head sunk obstinately on her breast.</p>

<p>“I shall never tell.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br>

THE UNKNOWN POISON</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I sat</span> fascinated. This was not the Violet Bredwardine
I had known. The girl had sprung up into
a woman, and the woman was making a brave fight
for me more than herself. If my name came out
she would be no worse off than she was already, as
far as her connection with the death in the Domino
Club was concerned. Her father would have to
know that she and I had been friends in the past, but
he need know nothing more. It was I who stood in
danger. It would be useless for me to deny that I
had drugged Weathered, and had carried off the
case-book. His death would lie at my door unless it
could be proved that something had been given to
him that night in addition to opium. And it would
take very strong evidence to convince a jury that
there had been anyone else concerned in that night’s
business besides me.</p>

<p>Whether her refusal to betray me was due only
to loyalty, or to a faint survival or revival of the
love I had forfeited, I could not tell. I only knew
that my own heart was touched anew, and I longed
more than ever to redeem myself in her eyes and
wipe out the past.</p>

<p>The Earl of Ledbury controlled his wrath with
an effort. He may have seen that it would be useless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
to persist just then. He may have feared to
press his daughter too far in our presence lest she
should make some admission that would bring her
within reach of the law.</p>

<p>“Very well; if that is your attitude, you have
ceased to be my daughter. You will pack up your
things and go to London by the afternoon train. I
shall wire to Miss Pollexfen to meet you, and you
can stay in my house till she has found you a home
with some respectable family; and I shall pay for
your board as long as you choose to remain with
them. Beyond that I have done with you. Now go.”</p>

<p>Violet got up, shivering all over, to obey. Her
misery was too acute for me to indulge in selfish
thoughts of what her forced emancipation might
mean for me.</p>

<p>The Earl turned to Sir Frank as if by an afterthought.</p>

<p>“Have you gentlemen anything else to ask Lady
Violet before she goes?”</p>

<p>My chief passed on the question to me by a nod.
His own expression was one of pity. I caught at
the opportunity.</p>

<p>“Nothing for the moment, but I presume your
lordship will be willing to let us have Lady Violet’s
new address if we should want it later on.”</p>

<p>It was the first time I had spoken since Lord
Ledbury came into the room, and he glared at me as
though resenting my presumption.</p>

<p>“Lady Violet is of age,” he said shortly. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
have just been reminded of that. She is her own
mistress; you had better ask her.”</p>

<p>Violet slowly turned and faced me. I threw
all I dared of longing and pleading for forgiveness
into the look I gave her. The despair in her eyes
found a dull echo in her tone.</p>

<p>“I will send you my address as soon as I know
it. But it will make no difference. I....”</p>

<p>Her voice choked. The next moment the door
had closed on her.</p>

<p>And now Tarleton proceeded to astonish me.
I think he astonished the Earl of Ledbury as well.</p>

<p>“My lord,” he said in a tone of deep gravity,
“it is clear to me that you have no idea of the danger
in which your daughter stands.”</p>

<p>“Danger!” The Earl fairly started.</p>

<p>“Danger,” the consultant repeated firmly. “The
man whose death has brought us down here was an
unscrupulous scoundrel. He laid traps for women.
Under the pretence of soothing their nerves he induced
them to tell him their secrets, and to write
him letters containing their inmost thoughts. There
is every likelihood that he met his death at the hands
of some woman whom he had entrapped in that
way, and whom he was attempting to blackmail.”</p>

<p>“But what has that to do with my daughter?”
his lordship burst out. “You don’t suppose that
she knew he was going to be murdered?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t suggested it. The evidence is to the
contrary, I am glad to see. But your daughter has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
been beguiled into writing to this man, and in her
innocence she has very likely written a good many
things that you would not care to see published.
Those letters are still in existence, probably, and we
don’t know in whose hands. Until they are found
and destroyed Lady Violet will be at the mercy of
the holder.”</p>

<p>“Wretched girl!” Even now the selfish father
could find nothing better to do than to blame his
child.</p>

<p>“Who made her wretched?” Tarleton’s face
wore the stern look of a judge passing sentence.
“Who drove her to confide in a stranger and a charlatan?
Who handed her over to a hired companion
whom she seems to have disliked and distrusted?
Who taught her to look for sympathy anywhere except
from her own parent and in her own home?”</p>

<p>Never have I witnessed a rebuke better administered
or with better effect. Lord Ledbury was
utterly subdued. If the condemnation had come
from a young man like myself, or from a professed
preacher, he might have tried to defend himself. But
from a man of his own age, and a man in authority,
the representative of law and public opinion, it was
an unanswerable charge.</p>

<p>For the best part of a minute he sat silent. His
face worked. Memories of the past must have come
back to him; perhaps he asked himself what account
he could give to Violet’s mother of her only child.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
His voice was altered and broken when he spoke
again.</p>

<p>“You have been very plain with me, Sir Frank.
I recognize that you have spoken as a friend—as
my daughter’s friend at least, if not mine. It may
be that my treatment of her has been mistaken, although
I meant it for the best; at all events, it has
turned out unfortunately. But her good name is the
first consideration now. These letters—what do you
advise me to do?”</p>

<p>The physician considered for a time before he
spoke.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know of the existence of these letters
when I came down here, and the problem is one that
requires thinking out. It may be that they will give
us a clue to the whole mystery. As far as I can see
at present, three things may have happened to them.”</p>

<p>He turned from Lord Ledbury to me as he
went on.</p>

<p>“Weathered may have kept them in the same
safe with his case-book. In that case the person who
opened the safe and carried off the book ought to
have found the letters as well. But according to my
present theory the person who took the book was the
wearer of this costume—” he pointed to the dress
in front of us. “In other words, he or she was
Lady Violet’s friend. And if her friend had found
any such documents he would have destroyed them
and let her know at once. In my opinion, therefore,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
either he overlooked them, or they were kept in some
more secret receptacle.”</p>

<p>As Tarleton seemed to expect my opinion I
nodded in confirmation. I could have sworn that
the safe contained no such correspondence, but that,
of course, I dared not tell him.</p>

<p>“The next person who seems to have had access
to the safe,” said the consultant, “was Weathered’s
step-daughter. And if he had some other hiding-place
in the house she is the most likely person to
have known of it, and to have opened it since his
death. Her mother, no doubt, would have a better
right to examine her husband’s papers, but she impressed
me as a weak woman, very much in her
daughter’s hands. We have to face the possibility
that Lady Violet’s letters have been found by a
young woman of very determined character who has
actually denounced her ladyship to Dr. Cassilis and
myself as guilty of this man’s death.”</p>

<p>The Earl showed himself greatly shaken.</p>

<p>“But this is terrible. You, sir, and you”—he
appealed to each of us in turn—“don’t believe anything
so hideous.”</p>

<p>“Not for one moment.” It was my chief who
answered. “Our presence here is the best proof of
that. We found ourselves accused by this young
woman of hushing up the case and screening the
criminal, and we came down to obtain proof of Lady
Violet’s absence from the scene of the crime. You
have nothing to fear on that score, I hope and believe.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
You can trust us both not to let anyone
know of the admission Lady Violet has just made to
you that she lent her costume to someone else.”</p>

<p>“To the actual murderer, do you mean?” the
father gasped.</p>

<p>“Not necessarily. That point is still in doubt.
As I have said, the crime may have been committed
by a woman—or a man—who had been driven to
desperation. I should be glad to think so, and to
think that he or she had seized the secret correspondence.”</p>

<p>“Why?” It was Lord Ledbury who put the
question, but I waited for the answer with equal
curiosity.</p>

<p>“Because in that case we might have every hope
that it would be promptly destroyed. Such a victim
would have no motive to injure her fellow victims,
and we might credit her with a sense of honour.
Whereas the step-daughter has shown a strong animus
against Lady Violet, and we know that she is
not too scrupulous when her feelings are aroused.
If Miss Neobard has found these letters it may take
some pressure to make her give them up.”</p>

<p>The Earl wrung his hands. “My means are
not large, but if any sum within my power—” he
began.</p>

<p>Tarleton cut him short with decision.</p>

<p>“That is one means which must not be resorted
to, my lord. I must make that an absolute condition.
The one thing I have to ask of you is that you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
will protect your daughter from any attempt that
may be made to blackmail her. Try, if you can, to
win her confidence. I strongly advise you to come
up to town with her yourself. Her chaperon has
shown herself to be incompetent, and I shouldn’t let
her into your house again. Look out for some
bright, sympathetic woman of the world, and don’t
engage her unless Lady Violet takes to her as a
friend. And let it be seen that your daughter is
under your personal protection. A blackmailer who
would find a solitary girl an easy prey will think
twice before he threatens one who is guarded by
a father in your position. Take her with you to
the theatres and picture galleries. Believe me, as
a doctor, she is in need of distraction just now. I
won’t answer for her sanity unless she can be cheered
up and taken out of herself. I will call on her, with
your permission, and keep an eye on her for a time.”</p>

<p>The change in the Earl of Ledbury was great
indeed by now. He thanked the consultant with
emotion, and undertook to carry out all his recommendations.
He pressed us both to stay and lunch
with him, but my chief decided that we could not
spare the time.</p>

<p>“We must get back to town as soon as possible,”
he declared. “The sooner we get on the track of
the missing letters the better chance there will be of
our recovering them.”</p>

<p>He shook hands with the Earl very cordially at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
parting and his lordship seemed to include me in his
expressions of gratitude and good-will.</p>

<p>When we were seated in the car going back to
Hereford my chief summed up the situation for my
benefit.</p>

<p>“There was a possibility that Lady Violet had
lent her old disguise to a friend as a blind and come
to the dance in a new one. I thought it was on
the cards that she might prove to be the Leopardess.
Now I think we may rule that out, and I am very
glad of it. She is a dear girl, and I confess she has
won my heart.”</p>

<p>I glanced at him a little uneasily. In spite of
his age, Tarleton was a fascinating man. I had seen
enough of him to know that he was popular with
women of all ages. Young women seemed to regard
him as an uncle, and became familiar with him at
very short notice; and I could not be sure that he
always regarded them strictly as nieces. Glad as I
was that my chief had acquitted Violet in his mind,
I was not altogether pleased by the warmth with
which he spoke.</p>

<p>“We may take it that she lent her dress to a
friend who meant to impersonate her. We don’t
know whether the friend had a grievance of her
own against Weathered, or whether she was acting
as Lady Violet’s champion. And in the second case
we can’t say whether Lady Violet knew or guessed
what her champion intended to do. You see, there
is still a serious case against the poor girl. If the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
police knew that she was in Weathered’s power, and
that she had lent her costume to his murderer, they
might come to a very ugly conclusion.”</p>

<p>“I am certain she had no idea that any crime
was going to be committed,” I spoke earnestly.</p>

<p>“Quite so; you feel certain of that, but Captain
Charles might feel certain of the opposite. You see
now why I thought it better for us to come down
here instead of one of his men.”</p>

<p>I did indeed see it, and inwardly I thanked Sir
Frank with all my heart.</p>

<p>“I think we will tell Charles that we obtained
satisfactory proof that Lady Violet was at Tyberton
Castle on Wednesday night, and that her maid found
the Zenobia costume for us in her wardrobe. That
ought to make him dismiss her from the case.”</p>

<p>I could have asked for nothing better, so far.
“And the letters?” I put in anxiously.</p>

<p>“Ah! I didn’t care to tell Lord Ledbury all I
feared about them. I shouldn’t be surprised if
Weathered had stored them in the Domino Club.”</p>

<p>I could not restrain a cry of alarm.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Tarleton went on, “that would be the
worst case of all. Because by this time they must
be in the hands of Madame Bonnell.”</p>

<p>The smooth, smiling face of the Frenchwoman
with its shrewd black eyes and thin lips rose before
me. As my chief had said, this was the worst case
of all.</p>

<p>“If that woman has them it may be some time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
before we hear of them,” the specialist pursued in
a meditative tone. “She may wait till the inquiry
into the death is over, and the case disposed of as
far as the police are concerned. Then the victims
will each receive a discreet letter, probably from an
agent, informing them that certain letters which
appear to be in their handwriting have been found,
and asking if they wish to have them returned.
There won’t be a word about money in the first
communication, you may be sure. The victims will
simply be invited to call on the agents and inspect the
letters. That woman knows her business, I fancy.”</p>

<p>It was horrible to think of Violet being slowly
drawn into the serpent’s coils. There would be less
mercy to look for in such a woman than in Weathered
himself.</p>

<p>The physician moved his shoulders as if to shake
off an unpleasant burden.</p>

<p>“We will put that aside for the moment, and consider
the question of the murder. Everything now
depends on the information I expect to find waiting
for me when we get back. If my diagnosis is correct,
Weathered died from a poison described in the
book I have told you of, <i>Across Sumatra</i>, by Captain
Armstrong. The natives have some name for
it which I forget, but I have called it <i>Upasine</i>.”</p>

<p>“Upasine!” I repeated the name in stupefaction.</p>

<p>“Yes. You have heard, no doubt—everybody
has heard—of the famous upas tree. According to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
the tales of the old explorers, it was a tree that exhaled
a deadly vapour, so that the traveller who went
to sleep beneath its shelter never woke again. The
bones of animals were found scattered round the
trunk, and they were supposed to have perished
in the same way, by going to sleep within the
deadly radius.”</p>

<p>“But surely,” I said in astonishment, “surely
no one believes that any longer? I thought it had
been proved to be a fable.”</p>

<p>The great expert shook his head.</p>

<p>“There are not many fables that haven’t some
truth in them,” he pronounced. “The legendary
glories of Timbuktu were dismissed at one time as
travellers’ tales, but it turned out there was a city
called Timbuktu on the southern edge of the desert
of Sahara; that it was the great market to which the
caravans from the Mediterranean coast made their
way, and even that it once possessed something like
a university, when it became a refuge for the Moors
who were driven out of Spain. The accounts of the
upas tree and its fatal shadow were dismissed in the
same shallow way without any inquiry as to how they
originated. Armstrong happened to be an intelligent
man, and he told me that one of the objects of his
exploration of Sumatra had been to find out the
truth about the upas.”</p>

<p>My incredulity began to give way before my
chief’s sober words.</p>

<p>“He started out with the conviction that bones<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
and corpses had been found under some trees by
some explorers, who had accepted the native theory
that the tree cast a deadly spell on all within its
range. Other travellers had tested the theory and
found that it was possible to sleep under the tree in
perfect safety. And so they had treated the whole
thing as a pure fancy, without inquiring further.
Armstrong did inquire further, and perhaps you
can guess what he found?”</p>

<p>For some moments I was hopelessly puzzled.
“The leaves are poisonous, perhaps, and the sleepers
die because they have eaten them?”</p>

<p>“Not a bad guess. No; Armstrong discovered
a minute fungus that grows in the soil round the root
of the upas tree, and apparently nowhere else. The
animals that browse on this fungus are overcome
by sleep, and die without waking. It contains a
soporific poison which acts rather like opium at first,
but has a peculiar effect on the skin, which it dries
up like parchment. You were the first to draw my
attention to the parchment-like appearance of Weathered’s
face, you may remember.”</p>

<p>I did remember. A burden was lifted from my
heart by the recollection. Whatever peril I might
stand in from the law, I could assure myself at last
that I was not a murderer. The drug I had administered
to Violet’s persecutor had contained no grain
of any other poison than opium. And now I need
not fear that I had given him an overdose of that.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
He had died, he must have died, from the poison discovered
by the explorer of Sumatra. And that meant
that he had died by some other hand than mine.</p>

<p>The specialist continued his explanation.</p>

<p>“You see now why I asked you to make no more
remarks on what you saw. Whoever used this poison
probably believes that he is the only person
who possesses any, or even knows of its existence.
Armstrong’s book attracted very little notice. It
was badly written, for one thing, and there were no
illustrations, a fatal omission in a book of travels
nowadays. I don’t think there was a word about
this discovery in any of the reviews. Naturally the
murderer thinks that he is safe from detection.”</p>

<p>“How did you come to hear of the poison?” I
ventured to ask.</p>

<p>“In the simplest way. Captain Armstrong himself
brought me a sample to analyse.”</p>

<p>Of course! I could have kicked myself. Tarleton
was the one man to whom any such discoverer
would be certain to come for an opinion.</p>

<p>“He had picked and dried a handful or two of
the toadstools, as he called them, but they had
crumbled on the voyage home, and what he brought
me was dust. I detected the presence of an agent
not yet known to science, and I gave it the name of
upasine. It seemed to me so dangerous that an
unknown poison should be in the hands of anyone
but a man like myself, that I asked Armstrong to sell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
me all he had brought home, and he agreed to
do it.”</p>

<p>“But in that case—your bottle was untouched?”
I objected.</p>

<p>“True. It is clear that he deceived me. Either
he had parted with some of the poison before coming
to me, and didn’t like to admit it, or else he kept
some for himself as a curiosity. If it isn’t in his
possession, I expect to hear of it in the same quarter
as the leopard skin and claws.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br>

THE LADY OF THE LEOPARD SKIN</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I got</span> little more out of my chief during the rest
of the journey to town. The gold repeater came
into action as soon as we were seated in the train,
and I could only wonder what was the problem that
was still baffling that keen intelligence.</p>

<p>To me, I confess, the solution of the mystery
seemed now to be well in sight. On our return to
town I expected to find that Inspector Charles had
ascertained the present whereabouts of the explorer
of Sumatra. From him it should not be difficult to
learn the identity of the Leopardess, as I called her
in my own mind; and I took it for granted that she
was a victim of Weathered’s who had delivered herself
out of his power by the use of the deadly fungus
of the upas.</p>

<p>My one anxiety at present was the thought of the
missing letters. I wearied myself with speculating
as to whose hands they had passed into since the
murder, and by what means they could be recovered
and destroyed without their contents becoming
known. I was as far as ever from seeing my
way clearly when we arrived in Montague Street
that evening.</p>

<p>A serious disappointment waited for us there.
An official envelope stamped with the seal of New<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
Scotland Yard lay on the table in the hall. Before
I had closed the front door Tarleton had pounced
upon it, torn it open, and scanned the note inside
with an impatient scowl.</p>

<p>“Fool!”</p>

<p>He almost flung the Inspector’s communication
in my face. It stated briefly that Captain Armstrong
had met his death by malarial fever in Yucatan six
months ago; and that was all. I hardly know what
more Charles could have said, since he was quite
ignorant why the explorer’s address was wanted.
Tarleton sometimes failed to allow for the fact that
his assistants were not all gifted with his own quickness
of apprehension. However, I didn’t venture to
defend the delinquent.</p>

<p>My chief’s irritation soon subsided, and as soon
as we were seated at a well-spread table he acquitted
the Inspector handsomely.</p>

<p>“After all, I didn’t take Charles into my confidence,
as I have taken you, Cassilis. But now we
must set to work in earnest. What do you suggest
as the next step?”</p>

<p>The question was too much for me, as I had to
confess. Perhaps I was too much worried about the
letters to be able to give my mind to anything else.</p>

<p>The consultant smiled good-naturedly.</p>

<p>“Our only clue to Captain Armstrong’s friend
is his book. Books are produced by publishers,
and publishers pay royalties. By this time the publisher
of <i>Across Sumatra</i> ought to have heard from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
Armstrong’s executor. And the executor should be
able to put us on the track of the person who has
come into possession of his effects.”</p>

<p>He paused to let this reasoning sink into my
mind before he added, “I think this greatly simplifies
matters. It is much more likely that Armstrong
kept some of the upasine himself among his trophies
than that he gave it away, to a woman, above all.
Depend upon it, we shall find that it passed on his
death to the lady of the leopard’s claws.”</p>

<p>He seemed about to say more but broke off
abruptly, as though a new thought had struck him.
“She will have to be handled carefully,” was all he
said after a short silence.</p>

<p>It was impossible for me to listen any longer
without reminding him of the other task before us.</p>

<p>“Have you made any plans yet for the recovery
of the letters?” I asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“Ah!” He gave me a shrewd look. “You
are quite right to interest yourself in that business,
my boy. It is more important to protect Lady Violet
than even to detect Weathered’s murderer. The
living come before the dead, eh? I am inclined to
trust that part of the work to you.”</p>

<p>I suppose I must have shown some dismay. My
kindly chief proceeded to explain himself.</p>

<p>“We must begin with the assumption that
everything that Weathered left behind him, including
his correspondence, has become the property of
his widow. If he kept these letters in his house they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
must be now in her possession, unless her daughter
has annexed them. I think you should go round to
Warwick Street to-morrow morning, and ask to
see Mrs. Weathered.”</p>

<p>I thought of the rather commonplace widow, who
had appeared to be completely dominated by her
daughter, and I did not hope much from the interview.</p>

<p>“I doubt if she will part with them without Miss
Neobard’s consent,” I said with hesitation. “Even
if she has them.”</p>

<p>“Try,” the physician urged. “I should not be
surprised if that woman, quiet as she looked, was
deeper in her husband’s secrets than Sarah Neobard
was, in spite of her jealousy. Still waters run deep,
remember. See her alone, if you can, and put the
matter to her as a woman and a mother. Ask her
how she would feel if her own daughter had been
enticed to writing very confidential letters to a doctor,
and those letters were now in a stranger’s
hands. I fancy you will get something out of Mrs.
Weathered.”</p>

<p>“And if I fail?”</p>

<p>Tarleton compressed his lips rather grimly. “In
that case, one of us may have to show her that her
own daughter is not yet out of the wood. We have
both heard a confession from Sarah Neobard, and it
was not made under any pledge of secrecy.”</p>

<p>There the matter rested that night. The next
day soon after breakfast my chief set off to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
inquiries at the publishers of <i>Across Sumatra</i>, and
I started on my difficult errand to Warwick Street.</p>

<p>Only my knowledge of the desperate position in
which Violet had placed herself could have nerved
me to the task in front of me. It was painful
enough to have to plead for mercy from a stranger;
the prospect of having to threaten the mother
with her daughter’s prosecution for a crime of which
I did not believe her guilty was so repugnant to me
that I made up my mind beforehand not to act on
Tarleton’s hint. My confidence in his sense of justice
was very strong, but I felt that I was too much
in the dark myself to accept such a responsibility.</p>

<p>The blinds of the house were down, a circumstance
which I attributed to the presence of a corpse
inside. But there was a long delay in answering my
ring, and when the youthful butler opened the door
to me his untidy dress and rough hair suggested that
he did not consider himself on duty.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Weathered isn’t here,” he told me, without
ceremony, as soon as I asked to see her. “The
funeral took place yesterday and the ladies have gone
out of town.”</p>

<p>“Where have they gone?” I demanded in
dismay.</p>

<p>The youth put on a stolid look.</p>

<p>“My instructions are to say that letters will be
forwarded,” he answered, with a touch of sullenness.</p>

<p>And I could get no more out of him. To all
appearances Sarah Neobard and her mother had fled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>As soon as I had got over my first surprise, I
felt more relief than disappointment. Tarleton himself
would now have to take the matter in hand, and
I had more confidence in his power to deal with it
than in my own. When we met again at lunch
time I reported my failure to him, and he heard me
with a tightening of the jaws that boded no good to
the fugitives.</p>

<p>“Our friend Sarah has made a mistake,” he
commented. “She ought to have known that she
could not hide herself very long if the police really
wanted her. I think we can trust Captain Charles
to let us know where she is before many days have
passed. I wonder what she told her mother to persuade
her to run away like that.”</p>

<p>Again some thought seemed to strike him which
he did not see fit to disclose to me. He shook his
head doubtfully, and then sprang to his feet and
hurried to the telephone.</p>

<p>When he came back it was to tell me that the
police had been put on the trail of the two women.
“I have told them nothing about the letters,” he
added for my consolation. “We don’t want them
to get on the files of Scotland Yard if we can help
it. I have given them a hint that I have something
up my sleeve.”</p>

<p>He poured himself out a glass of wine and
sipped it with a relish.</p>

<p>“I have been more fortunate than you this
morning,” he resumed. “It appears that Armstrong<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
had another book in the press when he died, so that
his publishers have been in active communication
with his executor—or rather his executrix.”</p>

<p>The correction startled me. Tarleton had laid
some emphasis on the feminine termination.</p>

<p>“She is Armstrong’s sister, his only one. He
had no other near relations, so far as the publishers
could tell me, and with his solitary, wandering life
he is not likely to have had any intimate friends.
At all events, he left everything he possessed to his
sister. I have made sure of that by looking up the
will at Somerset House.”</p>

<p>The atmosphere seemed to become heavier as he
spoke. At last the quarry was almost in sight. If
the explorer had kept any of the mysterious poison
it must have passed into his sister’s possession on
his death.</p>

<p>“The publisher couldn’t tell me whether she was
a married woman or a widow,” the specialist continued,
“but he gave me her name and address: Mrs.
Amelia Baker, Carlyle Square, Chelsea.”</p>

<p>“Carlyle Square!” I ejaculated. “That is within
a stone’s throw of the Domino Club.”</p>

<p>My chief gave me a look of mild disappointment.</p>

<p>“Is that the only thing that strikes you? What
about the name?”</p>

<p>“Amelia Baker.” I repeated the name to myself.
“Baker”—surely one of the commonest of English
surnames. There must be hundreds of Bakers in
the London Directory. And yet I had a dim consciousness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
of some association with it that I couldn’t
quite fix. Tarleton’s patience gave out before my
helplessness.</p>

<p>“Think? Where did you come across that name
last?” He snatched out a slip of paper from his
breast pocket and passed it across the table.</p>

<p>It was the list of names he had given me to copy
three days before, the list of Weathered’s patients
who had given numbers under which, as we had
learned since from Violet, they could write to him.
And at the bottom of the list there stood, “Mrs.
Baker, 35.”</p>

<p>To me it looked like proof conclusive. This
was Weathered’s latest victim, to all appearance, and
in making her his enemy he had at last met his match.
I remembered the waiter’s description of her at the
dance in her savage dress and savage ornaments, as
though she meant by her attire to signify that she
was bent on vengeance. And now we knew that she
was in possession of a deadly drug which could be
given without fear of detection, as she might well
suppose if her brother had not told her of his dealings
with the great expert. Gerard had testified to
her showing a repugnance for Weathered that looked
like hatred. The case appeared to be complete.</p>

<p>Something like this I said to Tarleton, carried
away by my delight at the thought that I had now
no more to dread. But he did not show himself
altogether satisfied.</p>

<p>“There is such a thing as having too complete<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
a case,” he remarked in a meditative voice. “Even
if we are right in believing that we have found the
Leopardess, as Gerard called her, we have still to
prove that she murdered Weathered. The waiter
himself told us that she left early, hours before he
showed any symptoms of being poisoned. My instinct
tells me that there is something in this business
that I don’t yet know. There is no crime so difficult
to detect as one in which a woman is concerned.
In this case I find myself surrounded by women, and
every woman is an enigma to the wisest man.—Now
listen to this.”</p>

<p>He took out another paper from his pocket, and
read aloud from it.</p>

<p>“This is the report of the Inspector. He has
had men engaged in looking up all the names on that
list, and the moment it struck me that Armstrong’s
executrix might be the Mrs. Baker who figures there,
I asked Charles to let me know what his man had
found out. Here is what he writes: ‘Widow with
independent means. Perfectly respectable. Favourably
known to local tradesmen. Keeps two servants.
Interested in scientific movements. Sister of
well-known traveller. Visits freely in Chelsea. Has
friends among literary men and artists. Also fond
of animals, cats and birds. Not known to suffer
from any serious form of illness. Has been attended
by local doctor for small ailments. No connection
can be traced with Weathered.’—That is the police
report.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>It was a deeply disappointing one to me. My
vision of the enraged woman in her leopard costume
engaged in a murderous plot against a sinister blackmailer
faded as I listened. This harmless, middle-aged
woman, living quietly on her income in a good
neighbourhood, and amusing herself with animal
pets and such artistic and intellectual society as was
within her reach, failed altogether to come up to the
portrait my imagination had drawn.</p>

<p>Tarleton folded up the report and replaced it in
his pocket. “You and I will call on this lady presently,
and see if we can find out something more.”</p>

<p>I wondered what we should find. I was wondering
still when the physician’s car drew up before
a house in the pleasant little square named after
Chelsea’s most famous resident since the time of Sir
Thomas More. The house was only distinguished
from its neighbours by an air of dinginess which
seemed due to neglect. In spite of the two servants
kept by the owner or tenant, there was a lack of
neatness both outside and inside. The steps looked
in need of scrubbing, and the paint on the door was
disfigured with blisters. The door was opened to
Tarleton’s vigorous knock and ring by a housemaid
who had evidently not changed her dress since her
morning’s work was done, and the hall into which we
passed was more like an ill-kept lumber-room than
the ordinary entrance to a lady’s house.</p>

<p>The explorer had evidently left many treasures
picked up on his travels which his sister had taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
no great pains to arrange to the best advantage. Savage
weapons of various kinds were nailed up anyhow
on the walls, one hiding another. Horns of different
strange animals, either deer or oxen, surmounted
such doors as we could see. Our feet were entangled
in a draggled buffalo skin spread on the floor. The
maiden who let us in took no notice of our trouble
in following her, and offered no apology for the
untidiness of the surroundings. She led the way
upstairs to the first landing and threw open the door
of a front room which was no doubt dignified with
the title of drawing-room.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell the missus you’re here.”</p>

<p>With this ungracious promise, and without suggesting
that we should sit down, she shut us in and
left us. Tarleton glanced round him with a humorous
expression.</p>

<p>“I am reminded of what someone said of a famous
explorer—‘Sir —— is admirably qualified
to deal with savages because he is just as savage as
they are.’ Captain Armstrong seems to have shared
the same qualification with his sister, judging from
her household.”</p>

<p>The drawing-room resembled a museum as ill-arranged
as the hall. Cases of stuffed birds met the
eye in every corner. A badly preserved fish of enormous
size, lacking an eye, monopolized one wall; I
inclined to think it was a tarpon. The space was
choked with rickety small tables, and those pieces
of furniture dear to the past generation as chiffoniers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
and what-nots, every one laden with curiosities in
the way of shells, savage ornaments, beads and rude
knives in sheaths of coloured leather. But what
naturally drew our attention most were the skins that
strewed the floor and made all movement well-nigh
impossible, unless by way of skips and jumps. Every
known species of Africa, I should think, was represented,
except perhaps the elephant. Two of those
in sight were leopards, and my chief gave me a quick
look of triumph as he pointed them out. Neither of
them, none of the skins in fact, were mounted on
cloth in the common fashion. The owner of this
weird collection could have picked one up and fastened
it across her shoulders without the least
difficulty.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baker took some time to appear. Although
we had postponed our call till four o’clock, it is
probable that her siesta had been interrupted. Certainly
she had the air of having only been roused
from sleep long enough to make a rather imperfect
toilet. Her hair could best be described as touzled,
but it was of that light straw colour that lends
itself to a pleasing disorder. The face beneath was
bright and birdlike, animated by an expression of
lively interest amounting to perkiness. The dress,
I can only suppose, was intended to rank as a tea-gown,
although it was strongly suggestive of a
dressing-gown. But whatever impressions of slovenliness
and neglect were produced by Mrs. Baker’s
appearance and surroundings, they were almost instantly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
dissipated by her manner, which was the perfection
of genuine cordiality and ease.</p>

<p>“I’m ashamed to have kept you waiting, Sir
Frank!” she exclaimed, grasping me warmly by the
hand. “But dear me,” she proceeded before I could
speak, “if I haven’t mistaken the son for the father!
How are <i>you</i>, Sir Frank! I declare the likeness
would deceive anybody.”</p>

<p>My chief extricated his hand from her friendly
clutch with a smile.</p>

<p>“You flatter me, madam. Dr. Cassilis, I regret
to say, is no relation to me, though he is good enough
to assist me.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Baker was not in the least embarrassed.
Her smile at the mistake was heartier than either
of ours.</p>

<p>“Just like me,” she avowed good-naturedly. “If
there’s a chance for me to put my foot in it, I’m sure
to do it. And I know you so well, by name, of
course. To think of all our diseases being due just
to tiny weeny insects! I’m sure everybody ought
to be grateful to you.”</p>

<p>It was apparent that there was some slight confusion
in the mind of our hostess between Tarleton
and some other scientist of equal if not greater eminence—possibly
the immortal Pasteur. Meanwhile,
one thought possessed my mind to an extent that
made me indifferent to everything else. This chatty,
blundering, good-natured creature could by no conceivable
possibility be connected with the tragedy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
in the Domino Club. Whatever part she had played
and whether she had or had not been present on the
fateful night, it was no less than absurd to credit her
with any responsibility for Weathered’s death.</p>

<p>With an agility which I could only envy she
skipped lightly over the many pitfalls that bestrewed
the floor, and stage-managed us both into comfortable
chairs, while she took up an attitude on a couch
smothered in cushions, which faintly recalled Thorwaldsen’s
statue of Ariadne.</p>

<p>“I hope you will accept my condolences on Captain
Armstrong’s death, if it’s not too late,” the
consultant contrived to slip in presently.</p>

<p>The bereaved sister brightened up. Doubtless
this was the clue she had wanted to our reason for
calling on her.</p>

<p>“To be sure!” she exclaimed. “You knew my
brother, of course. Everybody knew him. What a
man he was! The greatest explorer who ever lived,
so I think. He would have discovered America,
and Livingstone, and the North Pole, if only those
other people hadn’t done it first.” Her face fell for
a moment, as she added, “He was careless in money
matters, I know. It was his open, generous nature.
Did he borrow from either of you gentlemen?”</p>

<p>The question was put in a tone of resignation
which I understood as soon as we had both disclaimed
any such transaction with the late Captain
Armstrong.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>“I am so thankful,” the loyal sister sighed. “So
many of his friends have come to me since his death
was announced in the papers, and they all brought
I O U’s for money that he owed them. I have paid
them all, of course, but I had to do it out of my own
money. Poor Edgar left nothing.”</p>

<p>I glanced at my chief in some surprise. But he
knew the world better than I did, as his answer
showed.</p>

<p>“I was afraid that his books hadn’t brought him
in very much, valuable as they were to science.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Baker shook her head. “Not one of them
paid its expenses. I had to advance the money to
publish them, and I don’t suppose I shall ever get
it back.”</p>

<p>“You have some things to remember him by, at
all events,” Tarleton suggested. “Those leopard
skins are very fine.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes.” The sister brightened up again.
“Everything he brought home he gave to me. It’s
a wonderful collection, isn’t it? People tell me I
ought to give it to the nation. I think I shall leave
this house and its contents to trustees as a memorial,
like Carlyle’s house in Cheyne Row, you know.”</p>

<p>We could only express approval of this pious
intention. My chief now came to the object of our
visit.</p>

<p>“Captain Armstrong did me the honour to come
to me some time ago, after his return from Sumatra.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
He had heard of me as a student of poisons, and he
brought me a sample of one he had discovered.”</p>

<p>“I know the one you mean, the toadstool that
grows round the upas tree. Wasn’t that a wonderful
discovery? I can tell you——” She checked
herself rather sharply, and said no more.</p>

<p>“I persuaded him to sell me all he had brought
to England,” the specialist remarked, without appearing
to notice anything. “But it has occurred to me
since that he might have kept a little as a specimen,
and if that is so, and you are disposed to part with
it, I shall be glad.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Baker eyed us with a touch of uneasiness,
I thought.</p>

<p>“I know I can trust you, Sir Frederick; and if
Dr. Castle is your assistant I suppose I can trust him
too. Dear Edgar did leave me a little bottleful, but
he told me not to part with it to anyone, and not
even to let anyone know I had it.”</p>

<p>This was disconcerting news. I saw Tarleton’s
thick eyebrows go up and down.</p>

<p>“That was very sound advice,” he responded
quietly. “However, your brother trusted me, as I
have said, and I hope you can do the same. I shall
be very greatly obliged if you will let me see the
bottle.”</p>

<p>The little woman got nimbly off the couch.
“After all, it will be a relief to me to get rid of it,”
she murmured. “I have always taken care to keep
it under lock and key.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>She produced a bunch of about two dozen keys
from her pocket, all of them of that common design
that will open each other’s locks with ease, and advanced
to a chiffonier. “It is in here,” she informed
us as she threw back the flimsy door and
thrust her head inside.</p>

<p>The next moment we heard a startled cry.</p>

<p>“The bottle is gone!”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

THE RED LIGHT</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Frank</span> and I both sprang to our feet to go
to the chiffonier. But it was useless to turn over the
rubbish it contained. The bottle of upasine was not
there. And either the sister of the explorer was a
very perfect actress or she was as much surprised
as I was by its disappearance.</p>

<p>“Whoever can have taken it?” she cried, gazing
at us as if not quite certain that we were beyond
suspicion of the theft. “Both my maids have been
with me for years, and I have never missed anything
before.”</p>

<p>It was at moments like these that I most admired
my chief. The encounter with a new perplexity
seemed to afford him the keenest pleasure. He
was like an angler who finds that he has hooked a
trout where he only expected a chub. I could see
from the knitting of his brows that he was already
readjusting his ideas to this new factor in the case,
and working out a different solution.</p>

<p>His first step was to soothe the mistress of the
house.</p>

<p>“If you will allow me to help you I think we
may be able to get on the track of the thief. Shall
we sit down and talk it over quietly?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Baker, still rather distrustful, let herself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
be led back to her couch. But this time she did not
attempt a statuesque pose. She sat bolt upright,
turning her head from one to the other of us like
a nervous robin.</p>

<p>“You haven’t missed anything else, you say,”
Tarleton began, “so that it looks as though the thief
must have been someone who knew what he was
taking. The question is how many of your friends
knew about this poison?”</p>

<p>“Not one of them,” was the positive answer.
“I have never mentioned it to a soul.”</p>

<p>“Think,” the doctor persisted courteously.
“Remember that Captain Armstrong mentions his
discovery of it in his book, <i>Across Sumatra</i>. Surely
some of your acquaintances must have read the book
and talked to you about it?”</p>

<p>The little woman began to show signs of misgiving.</p>

<p>“I can’t remember,” she confessed.</p>

<p>She had shown us both already that memory was
not her strong point. The consultant prompted her
gently.</p>

<p>“The person most likely to be interested in such
a thing as a new poison would be a scientist or a
medical man.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Baker’s eyes sought the floor. “I am positive
that my doctor knew nothing about it. Besides,
I haven’t seen him for the last six months—not
since my brother’s death.” The disclaimer was made
in a rather shaken voice, however.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>“But a lady like you must have some acquaintances
in the scientific world,” the examiner insinuated.
“I was under the impression that I had heard
of you as a patroness of science.”</p>

<p>The flattery did its work. Mrs. Baker lifted her
head again and repaid it with a gracious smile.</p>

<p>“I am interested in science,” she admitted.
“When my poor brother was alive I used to give
At Homes for him to show his curiosities to people.
I have had as many as six Fellows of the Royal
Geographical Society at one time before now.”</p>

<p>“I felt sure of it. And you see your brother
may easily have mentioned this bottle, or shown it,
to someone without your knowledge.”</p>

<p>The birdlike head wavered. “But I am certain
that it hadn’t been taken when he died. I had to
make a list of everything he left for probate, and I
should have missed it if it hadn’t been there. And
I have had no At Homes since.”</p>

<p>It struck me that this was said rather unwillingly,
under the stress of conscience. Tarleton seemed
to think the same. The look he gave to the little
woman showed me that he believed she was keeping
something back.</p>

<p>His next question was a bombshell.</p>

<p>“May I ask if you have taken any interest in the
science of psycho-analysis?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Baker’s collapse was pitiful. If the specialist
had suddenly changed into a cobra before her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
eyes she could not have looked at him with greater
terror.</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Sir Roderick?” she
faltered.</p>

<p>Tarleton slowly shook his head.</p>

<p>“My dear madam, it is time for us to leave off
fencing with one another. Dr. Cassilis and I are
both incapable of betraying your confidence and
neither of us has the slightest desire to injure you.
This dangerous poison has been stolen from you,
and you cannot feel easy in your mind till you know
that it has been recovered, and is in safe hands. All
we ask is your help in tracing it, and that help I
am sure you feel that you ought to give.”</p>

<p>He had struck the right note this time. The
poor little woman took out her handkerchief and
dabbed her forehead in a distracted manner as she
nerved herself to speak.</p>

<p>“You are quite right, Sir Robert. I know I
ought to tell you everything, but it isn’t at all pleasant.
Have you ever heard of a Dr. Wycherley?”</p>

<p>The situation was too grave for these erratic
names to provoke a smile. “I have heard of Dr.
Weathered,” the specialist said gravely.</p>

<p>“Weathered, of course! How could I have forgotten
it. But I never can remember names, Sir
Herbert. He isn’t a friend of yours, I hope?”</p>

<p>“He never was.” Evidently she hadn’t heard
of the death in the Domino Club, and my chief didn’t
think the time had yet come to tell her of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>Mrs. Baker gave a sigh of relief before plunging
into her tale.</p>

<p>“It all began with my going to hear him give
a lecture on psycho-analysis at the Caxton Hall. He
looked quite a distinguished man, and he lectured
beautifully. I was fascinated by the things he said.
He told us that he could look inside our minds, and
see things there that we had never dreamt of—in our
subconscience, he called it.”</p>

<p>“Subconsciousness, yes,” Tarleton put in with
the least touch of impatience.</p>

<p>“I dare say that was it. He said we might have
murderous propensities without knowing it. Think
of that! I might be secretly longing to kill my dear
brother, and if the propensity wasn’t found out and
removed in time, I might end by doing it. I was
horrified.”</p>

<p>I confess I was horrified, too, as I grasped the
methods by which Weathered had drawn this harmless
little creature into his toils.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t sleep for thinking of all the dreadful
things that my subconscience might be planning and
plotting behind my back. I felt I must know the
worst, so as to be on my guard against it. I went
to consult Dr. Weathered at his house, and it was
a dreadful experience. He found out that I had a
murderous propensity. And he told me that the
only way for me to rid myself of it was to write
letters to him telling him every evil thought that
came into my mind.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>My chief and I looked at each other. There was
no need of words to express the idea we had in common.
There could be little doubt as to Weathered’s
line of action. He had found himself dealing with
a credulous weak-minded simpleton, and he had proceeded
to use the power of suggestion. He had
simply put into the poor woman’s mind the thoughts
he pretended to be driving out. The only question
that remained was whether he had gone so far as to
instigate her to the commission of a crime.</p>

<p>“I wrote him letter after letter,” Mrs. Baker
continued. “Every time I felt angry with one of
the maids I had to let him know. Sometimes he
answered the letters, and sometimes he didn’t. When
he did write he generally asked me questions about
how I was tempted to commit the murder. That
was how he found out about the poison.”</p>

<p>Even I had seen this coming. Tarleton no doubt
had seen it some time before, and worked up to it
deliberately; but he let no sign of satisfaction appear.</p>

<p>“Did he ever ask you to let him have it?” he
asked. The answer surprised me.</p>

<p>“No, never. He told me to be very careful never
to part with it.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I understand. He told you to take the
greatest care of it, and you told him exactly where
you kept it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes.” The explorer’s sister gazed at him
in admiration. “How did you guess that?”</p>

<p>“I think it is quite plain, ma’am. He didn’t want<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
you or anyone else to be in a position to say that
he had obtained the poison from you. With the information
you gave him he could walk into the house
at any time, and take it—secretly.”</p>

<p>This was a development I hadn’t foreseen. Was
the mystery going to resolve itself into a case of
suicide, after all? After failing to put an end to himself
by means of opium, had Weathered finally resorted
to a more certain drug? But then, in that
case, why shouldn’t he have demanded it openly
from his deceived patient? Truly the riddle was
becoming more insoluble as we advanced.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baker was rather indignant at the suggestion
that her precautions for the security of the dangerous
bottle had not been sufficient; but the
consultant brushed aside her objections almost
irritably.</p>

<p>“Nonsense, my dear woman, that lock of yours
could be picked by a clever child of twelve. All that
the thief had to do was to come to the house when
he knew you were out, give a false name to the
servant, and ask to be allowed to wait. As soon
as he found himself alone in this room he could
help himself to what he wanted, and then remember
an engagement, and come away. Very likely the
maid who would let him in wouldn’t even trouble to
tell you a visitor had called.”</p>

<p>The mistress of the house was reluctantly
obliged to admit this possibility. Tarleton folded
his arms, a sign that the interview was over as far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
as his interest in it was concerned, but he was good
enough to give me a chance of satisfying my
curiosity.</p>

<p>“What do you say, Cassilis? Do you think we
ought to ask Mrs. Baker to tell us anything more?”</p>

<p>I thought our hostess looked as little willing as
I was to leave her story unfinished.</p>

<p>“Oh, but you must hear the end,” she protested.
“And you mustn’t go away without so much as a
cup of tea.” She hopped lightly to the electric bell.
“I want you to know that I’m not a patient of Dr.
Weathered any longer; and I think I ought to tell
you why—when the maid is gone.”</p>

<p>The saving clause was prompted by a rough bang
at the door, followed by the entrance of the untidy
servant. She had anticipated her mistress’s orders,
and brought in a huge tray laden with food sufficient
to satisfy a large party of hungry people.
The variety of sandwiches was amazing. Mrs.
Baker’s popularity with the local tradesmen and the
success of her At Homes seemed to be fully
explained.</p>

<p>“You will hardly believe it,” she resumed as
soon as we had settled down to a serious attack on
this provender, “but Dr. Willoughby ended by actually
tempting me to commit a crime.”</p>

<p>It was easier for us to believe than she supposed,
but I did my best to look incredulous.</p>

<p>“Yes, Dr. Carstairs, he told me that the only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
way to get rid of my murderous propensities was to
give way to them. He advised me to kill Samuel.”</p>

<p>This really was beyond my power to believe.
“Samuel?” I repeated.</p>

<p>“Yes, my beautiful black cat, the one that slept
at the foot of my bed every night.”</p>

<p>Tarleton raised his head quickly.</p>

<p>“Did he suggest that you should give him the
poison from Sumatra?” he put in.</p>

<p>The explorer’s sister nodded.</p>

<p>The object of the advice she had received was
plain enough. The scoundrel wanted to test the effect
of the poison; perhaps he felt some doubt if it was
still active. Beyond that his intentions were dark.
Such a man was quite capable of committing a murder
by deputy, and he might have designed to make
an instrument of this deluded patient of his. But,
if so, there was nothing to tell us whose life he had
been aiming at. He had felt himself to be surrounded
by enemies, according to Madame Bonnell’s
statement. He may have wished to provide himself
with a weapon for use in case of need.</p>

<p>The worthy owner of Samuel told us that she
had refused to slay her pet.</p>

<p>“I sent him away for fear I should be tempted
to kill him,” she said with tears in her eyes. “I
found him a happy home with a former maid of
mine who is married and living in the country. She
writes me about him once a month, when I send her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
a postal order. I shall never dare to have him
back again.”</p>

<p>My youthful indignation became too much for
me.</p>

<p>“There is not the slightest reason why you
shouldn’t have your cat back to-morrow,” I said
bluntly. “You are no more likely to kill it than I
am. The man was telling you a pack of lies from the
beginning. Sir Frank Tarleton will tell you the
same. We have been finding out a good deal about
this man during the last few days; and you were
not his only victim.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Baker opened her eyes in a way that showed
more offence than gratitude. I had gone the wrong
way to work to disabuse her.</p>

<p>“I am much obliged to you, Dr. Cassidy,” she
said stiffly, “but I much prefer to be on the safe side.
We none of us know the secrets of our own hearts,
it seems to me. I consider Dr. Witheredge a cruel
man, and I have done with him; but he was extremely
clever; and I am satisfied that there is
something in the science of psycho-analysis.”</p>

<p>Tarleton came to my rescue. “The more there
is in it the more dangerous it may be in the hands
of a clever man without scruples. If you’ll allow
me to say so, I think you acted very wisely in deciding
to have nothing more to do with Dr. Weathered.”</p>

<p>The lady accepted this graciously, and smoothed
down her ruffled feathers. I thought I might venture
on a fresh question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>“Did you know that he was the real proprietor
of the Domino Club?”</p>

<p>“Never! You don’t say so? I understood it
was run by a Frenchwoman—Madame Bonnet.”</p>

<p>“You have been there, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Only once. I heard so much about it that I
thought I must go and see what it was like. I was
there only last Wednesday. But I didn’t stay more
than an hour. Dr. Weathell was there, disguised as
an Inquisitor, and I was so afraid of his recognizing
me that I came away.”</p>

<p>There could be no doubt, as far as I could see,
that this was the truth. And if it was the truth
the lady of the leopard skin and claws was now ruled
out of the case. Her part in it had been confined
to supplying the poison, or rather in innocently letting
it be known where it could be found. To clinch
the matter I said:</p>

<p>“I wasn’t there, but we heard that a lady had
been present who left early. She wore the skin of a
leopard, and a necklace of leopard’s claws.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that was me; I went as a Leopardess,”
our amiable hostess responded with a frankness
which put an end to the last doubt. She added in
a tone of quiet triumph, “I can see now that that
was where my murderous propensities came out.
Why else should I have gone as a beast of prey?”</p>

<p>I had to admit that she had scored off me. Anything
less like a beast of prey or a potential murderess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
than the bright and birdlike little woman I
have never seen.</p>

<p>My chief picked out one point that I had overlooked.</p>

<p>“Did Weathered mention the Club to you,
ma’am? Or did you know this Madame Bonnell?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Baker drew herself up.</p>

<p>“I didn’t <i>know</i> her,” she said with emphasis.
“Such a person is not in my social circle. I knew of
her. A friend of mine in Chelsea gave me her card
when I went to buy a ticket for the dance, but she
was a friend of Madame Bunner’s. It was only
a form.”</p>

<p>The answer was equally decisive. It seemed clear
to me that the only person who could have known
of the existence of the poison, and abstracted it, was
the man who had perished by it. I saw Tarleton’s
watch come out of his pocket, and its slow, steady
motion told me that his brain was already at work
on the last winding of the mystery.</p>

<p>When we had done full justice to the refreshments
put before us we came away pledged to attend
the first At Home given by our hostess, which she
explained would be as soon as she was out of mourning
for her brother. I think she had won both our
hearts in spite of her eccentricities, and we entertained
no serious dread that her murderous propensities
would be indulged at our expense.</p>

<p>Tarleton was very silent till we were back at
Montague Street. Even when we were in his study<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
again he did not seem much disposed to discuss the
new situation with me. For the first time since the
beginning of the investigation I had the impression
that I was not entirely in his confidence.</p>

<p>When I expressed my curiosity as to Weathered’s
motive for stealing the bottle of upasine he
lifted his bushy eyebrows and looked at me almost
as if he were annoyed.</p>

<p>“We don’t know that he did steal it,” he growled.
“Everyone who read Armstrong’s book knew of
his discovery, and would expect to find some of the
new poison among his belongings. And as for that
little woman, she has probably babbled about it to a
dozen persons whom she has forgotten. Her memory
is like a sieve.”</p>

<p>The judgment struck me as harsh. Mrs. Baker
certainly had a genius for forgetting names, but so
have many people whose memories are good enough
in other respects. It seemed to me that she had
shown a pretty fair recollection of her dealings with
Weathered at all events; and I said so.</p>

<p>Tarleton hunched himself up in his favourite
armchair and growled again.</p>

<p>“You ask me to believe that a doctor who had
stolen what he knew to be a deadly drug, and who
was actually taking precautions to prevent himself
being poisoned at the time, was careless enough to
let it be taken from him?—Well, I don’t.”</p>

<p>I had never known him to speak so irritably before.
I sat dumb, asking myself what was in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
mind. And all at once the explanation flashed
upon me.</p>

<p>If he didn’t believe that Weathered had taken
the fatal bottle he must have been searching for the
probable thief among Weathered’s enemies. The
last question he had put to Mrs. Baker showed that
his thoughts had turned for a moment in the direction
of the Frenchwoman, who of all others had the
best opportunity to administer the poison. Who else
was left?</p>

<p>The one enemy of Weathered’s whom we both
knew of, the one person who had not only a reason
but, it might be said, a moral right to take his life
in self-defence was Violet Bredwardine. And she
had confessed to having lent the disguise worn on
the night of the murder by one who must have been
her friend, and probable champion. A dozen trifling
incidents rushed back into my mind; the specialist’s
anxiety lest his own bottle should have been tampered
with; the way he had contrived—it looked like
contrivance to me now—to give me a chance of meeting
Violet alone. There could be only one meaning
in it all.</p>

<p>My chief suspected me, had suspected me from
the very first, of being the murderer. The red light
was in my eyes at last.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br>

A SINGULAR DISMISSAL</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Perhaps</span> it may be wondered why I didn’t at
once make a frank statement of my part in the mystery
to my kind-hearted chief and throw myself on
his mercy.</p>

<p>I was withheld by more than one reason. In the
first place I couldn’t feel sure that I should be believed.
I had no means of proving my innocence.
The circumstantial evidence against me was as strong
as it could be. I had the strongest motive to kill
the monster who was trying to put my secret to the
basest use; I had been on the spot, and been there in
disguise; and I had given him a drug which was only
less dangerous than the one that had caused his
death. Who would believe that I had stopped short
there? And Sir Frank Tarleton had shown by this
time that he did not believe me. To him, as to everyone
else, it must appear evident that the man who
was prepared to commit a crime in defence of a
woman would be prepared to tell a lie as well.</p>

<p>Then, again, the relations between my chief and
me were not merely private ones. Both of us were
Government officials, and I owed my own post to
his recommendation. His official conscience might
well be different from his private one. He might be
willing to make excuses for me personally, and yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
feel it his duty to report to the Department we both
served that I was no longer worthy of its confidence.</p>

<p>And, lastly, there was the consideration that had
controlled my action all along. My secret was Violet’s
secret. To no living being had I a right to tell
it without her consent. That consent I need not
say no peril to myself would have tempted me to ask.
The only question I now put to myself was whether
I ought not to put her on her guard by letting her
know what I had come to fear.</p>

<p>I slept, or tried to sleep, that night without coming
to my decision. In the morning Sir Frank
extracted from the pile of letters beside his plate on
the breakfast-table one with an earl’s coronet on the
flap of the envelope.</p>

<p>He did not show me the contents, but said carelessly,
“I shall be out to lunch. Lord Ledbury is
anxious to see me in John Street.”</p>

<p>The news decided me. Before Violet was exposed
to any further questioning from my shrewd
chief she must be warned how things stood. I
couldn’t complain of not being included in the invitation.
In Lord Ledbury’s eyes naturally I was
a mere subordinate, only acting under Tarleton’s
orders.</p>

<p>There was another letter that interested the consultant
more than the Earl’s. It came from New
Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>“Sarah Neobard and her mother have gone
abroad,” he remarked with something like satisfaction.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
“Charles has sent a man after them. They
seem to have gone to Paris. You must have frightened
that young woman rather badly.”</p>

<p>I forced my wandering mind back to the subject
of the letters. Had they come into Sarah’s hands,
and, if so, had she taken them with her? After all,
this was a more pressing matter than any danger
of mine.</p>

<p>“Will it be possible for them to hide in Paris?”
I asked anxiously.</p>

<p>The specialist shook his head.</p>

<p>“Charles knows his business—up to a certain
point. Depend on it a smart officer will have been
there to meet them at the Gare du Nord, if the
French police were notified in time. I don’t think
there is much chance of two Englishwomen slipping
between the fingers of the Paris detective force.”</p>

<p>“Then what will be the next step?” I inquired
vaguely.</p>

<p>“I shall leave for Paris by to-night’s mail.”</p>

<p>The announcement was made curtly. The day
before it was I who had been charged with this part
of the case. I was to have interviewed Mrs. Weathered
and appealed to her womanly feelings on behalf
of her husband’s victims. Now it seemed that my
chief had changed his mind, and intended to see her
himself. I dared not even ask if I was to go with
him. A shadow had fallen between us which it was
not for me to pierce.</p>

<p>I held my tongue, and went on quietly with my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
breakfast. The consultant went through his mail,
passing on to me such letters as I was accustomed to
deal with on his behalf—requests for appointments
and consultations with other doctors, and so forth.
There was no sign that he had withdrawn his confidence
in me except when the mystery of the Domino
Club was concerned.</p>

<p>The meal was just over when a loud summons at
the front door was followed by the entrance of Tarleton’s
man showing in Inspector Charles.</p>

<p>The Inspector was in a state of excitement. In
his hand he carried a newspaper which he waved at
us both.</p>

<p>“Have you seen this morning’s paper?” he
called out before the door was closed. “The advertisement
in the Agony Column?”</p>

<p>Tarleton glanced at me before answering, and I
remembered his prediction to Lord Ledbury as he
spoke.</p>

<p>“What, have they got to work already? What
does it say?”</p>

<p>Captain Charles read out from the paper in a
round, commanding voice:</p>

<p>“Dr. Weathered, deceased. Any patients of the
late Dr. Weathered desiring to have their letters to
him returned are requested to apply, mentioning
number, to Messrs. James, Halliday and James, Solicitors,
Carmichael House, Chancery Lane, E.C.4.”
He did not spare us even the 4.</p>

<p>Sir Frank nodded approvingly. “Very well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
worded, very well worded, indeed. It sounds like a
perfectly respectable offer.”</p>

<p>It sounded so to me. But the Inspector was
puzzled.</p>

<p>“What does it mean?” he exclaimed. “Why
should they advertise? Why not return the letters
at once, or write to the patients? And why should
they want to know the exact numbers?”</p>

<p>“Ah, that is part of the case that I haven’t had
an opportunity of going into with you yet, Charles.
Won’t you sit down. The fact is, I have been rather
expecting some approach of this kind. Dr. Cassilis
and I have ascertained that Weathered induced some
of his patients to write him letters of a rather compromising
kind. The arrangement was that the letters
should be signed with a number instead of a
name, probably they bore no address. The object
of this advertisement is to find out who the writers
are. The demand for money will come later.”</p>

<p>“Blackmail!” the Inspector gasped in horror.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid so. An honest person who had
found such a correspondence would have burnt it.
You see now one of my reasons for not dropping the
case to oblige that Crown Prince of Slavonia.”</p>

<p>One of the reasons only. I had little doubt as to
another. Captain Charles looked extremely subdued.</p>

<p>“I had no idea of anything like this in the background,
I needn’t say, Sir Frank. I will look up
these solicitors at once. Chancery Lane—there are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
better addresses than that, and there are worse. Unless
you have anything else to advise.”</p>

<p>“I should advise you to find out what you can
about the solicitors, certainly. But I doubt if they
are in possession of the letters. I shouldn’t be surprised
if the letters were in Paris by this time.”</p>

<p>Captain Charles struck his forehead.</p>

<p>“Of course! The widow has carried them abroad
to be out of reach in case of trouble. It was fortunate
that we heard of their flight so soon. We
know where they are already. They have some
smart men in the Rue Jerusalem.”</p>

<p>“I shall be glad if you will write me a line of
introduction to the French police,” Tarleton responded.
“By the way, have you secured me that
finger-print yet?”</p>

<p>“I have it here, Sir Frank.” The Inspector took
out a substantial pocket-book and extracted a mounted
photograph, which my chief slipped into his own
pocket without giving it a glance. Charles looked
as if he were as much in the dark as I was as to the
meaning of this proceeding.</p>

<p>“It may come in useful,” was all the consultant
said. “But you were going to tell us where Mrs.
Weathered and her daughter were hiding.”</p>

<p>“They don’t seem to be hiding, that’s the curious
part of it. Perhaps they don’t understand the
law about extradition. They’ve put up at a respectable
hotel on Cook’s list, a hotel swarming with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
English tourists, the Hotel St. Catherine in the Rue
Tivoli.”</p>

<p>Tarleton knitted his brows at this intelligence.
“We don’t know yet the reason for their flight, if
it is a flight,” he observed thoughtfully. “We have
nothing against either of them so far, remember.”</p>

<p>He drew out his mascot and played with it gently
for a minute while Charles and I watched him in
keen suspense. Suddenly he looked up and spoke to
the Inspector in a brisk voice.</p>

<p>“We mustn’t lose time. Some unfortunate victim
may be answering that advertisement already.
Luckily, I have come across one of Weathered’s correspondents
whose letters to him were quite innocent,—that
Mrs. Baker your man reported on for
me. I want you to see her at once, using my name if
necessary, and get her authority to deal with these
solicitors on her behalf. Ask for the letters first,
and if they make some excuse for not parting with
them, ask who is instructing them. If they refuse to
give you their client’s name we shall know the worst.”</p>

<p>It seemed to me that we knew the worst already,
if my chief was right. As he had said, an
honest woman, finding such letters after her husband’s
death, would have put them in the fire. It
was more than ever imperative that I should see
Violet at once. She might have read the advertisement
by now, and taken it in good faith.</p>

<p>Directly after Captain Charles had left us I
made some excuse for going out on business, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
hailed the first taxi I saw. It was still early when
I got to John Street, Mayfair, where the Earl of
Ledbury’s modest town house stood. The door was
opened by the same man whom I had made a friend
of down at Tyberton, and I was careful to confirm
the friendship in the surest way. He was much
more smartly dressed on this occasion, and everything
about the house indicated that Lord Ledbury
had taken Tarleton’s advice to heart, and was preparing
to give his daughter her proper position in
the fashionable world.</p>

<p>Violet, too, was changed. Her dress was still a
little lacking in those touches which only the most
expensive houses can impart, but she bore herself
quite differently. Her father’s new-born care for
her had given her confidence, and done something to
banish the look of hopelessness and resignation I
had last seen on her face. I hate to confess it, but
glad as I was on her account I felt a little sorry on
my own. The old gulf between us I was beginning
to hope had shrunk, but now a new one seemed to
have opened. Who was I, what was plain Bertrand
Cassilis, M.D., that he should venture to go on
loving the bright star set high above him in the
social firmament?</p>

<p>“I think I know why you have come,” was her
greeting. She did not offer me her white hand.
“They are offering to return those letters. I can’t
tell you how thankful I shall be.”</p>

<p>It was what I had feared. I would have given<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
anything to leave her in ignorance, but the risk was
too great.</p>

<p>“Have you answered the advertisement yet?”
I asked.</p>

<p>“Not yet. I was tempted to go there at once,
but I thought I had better consult you first. Why,
is there anything wrong?”</p>

<p>She must have seen there was by this time from
my air. Yet at that very moment the knowledge
that she had thought of me, that she had put her
trust in me and no one else, made my courage rise;
and I answered her with a boldness that surprised
myself.</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven for that! I came here the first
moment I could to warn you to take no notice of
that advertisement. It shows that they don’t know
whom the letters are from, or they would have written
to you direct. Trust me; the matter is in good
hands; those letters shall either be returned to you or
destroyed unread, I swear it.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Bertrand. I do trust you. I know
it isn’t your fault if they haven’t been destroyed
already.”</p>

<p>The words rolled a great burden from my heart.
I was on the point of murmuring that I hadn’t deserved
her trust, but some instinct bade me refrain
from the least reference to the past. I believed that
the sad old wound was beginning to heal, and that
the best chance for both of us was to bury the past<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
in silence, and never to conjure up its ghost by one
single word.</p>

<p>Already Violet was forgetting her own trouble to
think of mine. She went on before I had found
anything to say.</p>

<p>“But what about yourself? Has anything more
been discovered about the murder?”</p>

<p>It was necessary for me to tell her what I feared.
“We have found what caused Weathered’s death,”
I answered. “It was a poison that only Sir Frank
Tarleton knew of. He recognized the symptoms
from the first, and now he has found out where it
was obtained from.” And I briefly related the story
of the stolen bottle.</p>

<p>Violet looked relieved when she had heard it.</p>

<p>“Then he must have stolen the bottle himself.
Did he commit suicide, do you think?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid that’s not what Sir Frank thinks.
Unless I am mistaken he suspects me of having
taken the bottle from Mrs. Baker. His manner
towards me has quite changed. He is going to
Paris to-night on the track of the letters, but he isn’t
taking me with him.”</p>

<p>I had alarmed her more than I meant. She uttered
a cry of despair.</p>

<p>“Bertrand! It isn’t true! Will he have you arrested?
Shall you be——” She began to sob.</p>

<p>“No, no; it isn’t as bad as that. There’s not
going to be any arrest if the police can help it. Any
way, I don’t believe Sir Frank would let them arrest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
me. But I shall have to resign my post, I expect,
and I may have to leave the country.”</p>

<p>She looked at me through her tears. “That will
be almost as bad, won’t it?”</p>

<p>It was all I could do to keep from answering,
“Not if you come with me.” But I could not take
advantage of her like that.</p>

<p>“I shall always have my profession,” I said.
“Sir Frank has confidence in me as a doctor, I
know. But I didn’t mean to distress you like this.
I shouldn’t have said anything to you about it, but
Sir Frank is coming here to lunch to-day, and I was
afraid he might find out something from you.”</p>

<p>“Surely you didn’t think that,” she protested.
“You don’t think I should betray you. If you had
killed that villain it would have been for my sake.
And he deserved to be killed.”</p>

<p>My heart glowed within me. I spoke out.</p>

<p>“And I would have killed him if I had seen no
other way. No, I didn’t think for a moment that
you would give me away knowingly; but Tarleton
is a past master in the art of sounding people and
extracting information from them unawares. I only
wanted to put you on your guard, lest you should
think that you could trust him as a friend of mine.”</p>

<p>“I certainly thought he was. He looked so kind
and good,” Violet said thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Perhaps I was a little irritated. “He impresses
all women in that way,” I said with a touch of jealousy.
“I could see that he admired you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>Violet’s eyes brightened. “I must try to make
a friend of him. If I let him see that—that I
should be sorry if any harm came to anyone through
me, perhaps that may influence him.”</p>

<p>I ought to have been very grateful, but I’m
afraid my response was lacking in warmth.</p>

<p>“Don’t tell him I have been here,” I said as I
rose to go. And she smiled at me rather pathetically
as she promised.</p>

<p>I had a rather dismal lunch by myself, wondering
what was passing at Lord Ledbury’s. When I
saw Tarleton again I was staggered by his gay appearance.
He had blossomed out in a new coat and
a white waistcoat and a fancy tie. Most wonderful
of all, the shabby black ribbon by which he was so
fond of swinging his watch had been replaced by a
brilliant gold chain that I had never seen before. It
was evident that he had decked himself to make an
impression in John Street.</p>

<p>He had not long been back when we had another
call from Captain Charles. He came in looking
grave, and greeted my chief with increased respect.</p>

<p>“I have been to Chancery Lane, as you advised,
Sir Frank, and seen the principal. There is only
one. The names in the advertisement are bogus ones,
unless he bought the good-will of some old firm going
out of business. The man’s real name is Stillman.
I saw it on his notepaper. And he strikes me as
hot stuff.”</p>

<p>“What did he say?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>“It was just what you expected. Made an excuse
for not giving me Mrs. Baker’s letters. Said he
was only authorized to hand them over to the writer
in person. And when I asked who was instructing
him, said he wasn’t authorized to give his client’s
name.”</p>

<p>Tarleton shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Clever, very clever,” he repeated. “There’s
nothing for you to take hold of, so far. If you go
back again with Mrs. Baker you will put him in a
corner, and very likely her letters will be given up, as
they contain nothing serious. It’s a nasty business.”</p>

<p>“What had we better do?”</p>

<p>“Do nothing till you hear from me again. I am
off to Paris to-night, and when I come back I shall
know where the letters are, if I don’t bring them
back with me.”</p>

<p>The Inspector bowed himself out quite meekly.
My curiosity prompted me to venture on a rash
question.</p>

<p>“Do you think it possible that Miss Neobard
has the letters?”</p>

<p>My chief swung himself slowly round in his
chair and gave me a steady look, under which I
quailed inwardly.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I ought to tell you, Cassilis. It
seems to me that you are an interested party.”</p>

<p>So my fear had been well grounded. I listened
breathlessly for more.</p>

<p>“From the beginning of this investigation you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
have shown a bias that is fatal in one who is playing
the part of a detective, or aspiring to play it. A man
in your position should be absolutely impartial. He
should not let himself be swayed for a moment by
personal prejudices or personal preferences. Now
you have all along showed a disposition to screen
Lady Violet Bredwardine. You have made excuses
for her to me, and you have defended her to others.
At the same time you have shown an inclination to
think the worst of Sarah Neobard. And your animus
against her came out most strongly when she
showed herself Lady Violet’s enemy.”</p>

<p>What could I say? I was only too thankful that
he had spared me any reference to the omission of
Violet’s name from the list I had copied for Inspector
Charles. That was a clear breach of duty, as I had
to admit to myself.</p>

<p>Sir Frank’s voice was perfectly bland as he
continued:</p>

<p>“Lady Violet is worthy of any man’s admiration,
and I am quite as determined as you are to protect
her from any dastardly use of her correspondence.
I should not have blamed you severely for anything
you might have done for her protection if you had
been acting in a private capacity. But you are here
in a responsible position. You owe it to the Home
Office and to me to conduct the inquiry into this
murder without fear or favour, whatever may be
the consequences, and whoever may be guilty. You
must ask yourself if you have done so.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>I am afraid I asked myself instead how much
he really knew. So far he had made no definite accusation.
He had charged me with nothing but a
display of personal sympathy and antipathy, a charge
which it would have been foolish to deny.</p>

<p>“It is a question of temperament, it seems to
me,” pursued the consultant in the same even tones.
“Sympathy is a valuable quality in a doctor, but it
is fatal in a criminal investigator. I think I made
a mistake in inviting you to enter the Government
service. You would get on better in private practice.”</p>

<p>The blow had fallen and I had only to make the
best of it. “Of course, I am in your hands, sir. If
that is your opinion I will send in my resignation.”</p>

<p>Australia, Canada, South Africa passed before
my mind’s eye as I spoke, as possible refuges for a
penniless medico. I could not hope for anything in
England after being practically dismissed from the
Home Office.</p>

<p>My prompt offer, however, seemed to have
greatly softened my judge.</p>

<p>“We will talk of that after I have come back
from Paris,” he said kindly. “For your own sake
I don’t advise any sudden step. And there is Lady
Violet to consider. As I said before, you have acted
as her champion. Anything like a public slur on
you, or an admission on your part that you were to
blame, would be certain to give her pain, even if it
didn’t reflect on her. She spoke of you to me this
morning in a very friendly way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>Poor Violet. So she had done the very worst
thing she could have done in my interest. To praise
a young man to an elderly admirer—what other
result could it have but to ensure his being driven
from the field?</p>

<p>I was too much cast down to make any response
to Sir Frank’s well-meant advice, beyond a silent
bow. He was as friendly as ever the next minute,
invited me to come to Charing Cross to see him off,
and shook my hand cordially at parting. I preferred
to walk home afterwards, dreading the dull hours
till bedtime. So miserable was I that, when I came
in, I should have gone straight upstairs without
looking to see if there were any letters for me if I
had not been arrested by a faint fragrance that had
many memories for me.</p>

<p>I looked down, and there was a delicate blue
envelope beckoning me by name.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Bertrand</span>,</p>

<p>I write at once to tell you that you have nothing to
fear from dear Sir Frank. He spoke of you most
highly to my father, said you had a distinguished career
before you, and that he would not take £3,000 a year for
your practice in a few years’ time.</p>

<p class="right">Yours, &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br>

MOTHER AND DAUGHTER</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Frank Tarleton</span> had not given me all his
reasons for not taking me with him to Paris. One
of them, as he told me afterwards, was that I had
made an enemy of Sarah Neobard, or, to put it the
other way, I had made her regard me as an enemy.
My chief believed that my presence would prevent
him from obtaining any information from her or
her mother. They would think he had come on a
hostile errand, and they would obstinately hold their
tongues, for fear lest anything they said might be
used by me against her.</p>

<p>Tarleton’s intention was to appear in the character
of a friend of Sarah’s, who did not share my
suspicions and only wanted to be able to clear her
from them. He was quite frank with me about the
way in which he had spoken of me in my absence,
and about everything else in which I was interested.</p>

<p>He put up at his favourite hotel, the Saint
Lazare, on his arrival, one that suited him because it
was near the centre of everything without being
overrun by English and Americans. He liked to be
among French people when he was in France. After
the “little breakfast,” that first delicious taste of
French coffee and French bread which atones for the
stuffiness of the French railway carriage, he made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
his way round to the Rue Jerusalem, where he was
received with high distinction by the head of the
French police to whom his name and official standing
were well known.</p>

<p>The Chief presented to him Brigadier Samson,
the detective who had the two fugitives under supervision,
and he undertook, at the doctor’s request, that
a formidable-looking gendarme in the showy uniform
of the French police should be stationed opposite
the Hotel Saint Catherine, in full sight from the
windows, till further notice.</p>

<p>Another small piece of business was transacted.
Tarleton laid before the Chief the photograph he
had obtained from Inspector Charles, and invited
him to find out if it corresponded with anything in
his register of finger-prints.</p>

<p>The hour now being reached at which the ladies
might be expected to show themselves, the visitor
next went on to their hotel in the Rue Tivoli. In
the hall he found the English detective who had followed
them from London, and who had taken a
room on the same floor, in the unsuspicious character
of a tourist who found himself in Paris for the first
time and was unwilling to venture far from his hotel.</p>

<p>“The birds are in their cage, Sir Frank,” he
reported as soon as he recognized the specialist.
“I’ve been hanging about here since the early morning
and I’ve arranged with the management that they
shan’t be allowed to go out by any other way.”</p>

<p>Tarleton, in reply, explained why he had asked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
for a gendarme to be posted across the way. “I
don’t want them to know that you’re a police officer,
of course; but I may want them to know that they
are being watched by the police.”</p>

<p>He had hardly finished speaking when the representative
of French law appeared on the scene, a
truly imposing figure with a huge moustache, who
began pacing the pavement opposite like a man who
was not to be trifled with.</p>

<p>The consultant asked if Mrs. Weathered had
taken a private sitting-room and finding that she had,
sent up his card, on which he had scribbled the words
“<i>Official Confidential</i>.” When he was handing it
into the office, however, the detective followed him
to make a correction.</p>

<p>“She’s not staying here under her own name.
She has taken the name of Neobard.”</p>

<p>He had to wait some minutes for a response.
When at length he was taken upstairs and shown
into the room he found, as he had expected, Miss
Neobard alone.</p>

<p>“My mother asks you to excuse her, Sir Frank.
She is not yet well enough to see anyone on business.
May I ask the meaning of those words on your
card?”</p>

<p>Sarah spoke with the utmost coolness. If she
was frightened she had evidently resolved to hide
her fright under a mask of defiance. Tarleton’s manner
was one of entire friendliness.</p>

<p>“They mean that although I have come to see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
Mrs. Weathered as a Government official, on official
business, our interview will be strictly confidential.
I shall not make use of any information she may
give me, without her consent.”</p>

<p>The daughter looked at him doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Does that apply to me as well?”</p>

<p>Sir Frank purposely hesitated before answering.</p>

<p>“There is no reason why I shouldn’t have a confidential
talk with you as well, if you desire it. But
at present I have only asked to see Mrs. Weathered.”</p>

<p>The name seemed to irritate the girl.</p>

<p>“My mother has dropped the name of Weathered,”
she said sharply. “In future she desires to
be known as Mrs. Neobard.”</p>

<p>Tarleton was struck by her tone. It conveyed
to him that the change of name had not been made
with a view to concealment, but was due to some
deeper cause.</p>

<p>Up to now Miss Neobard had made no reference
to the whereabouts of the travellers having been
so soon discovered. She now threw out the question
scornfully.</p>

<p>“I suppose the police are on our track, as we
came here without giving anyone our address. Is
that confidential?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not.” The doctor was getting a little
irritated by this time. “Your leaving London while
the mystery of Dr. Weathered’s death was still unsolved
was enough to provoke the suspicion of the
police. They were bound to keep you in sight.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>Sarah couldn’t very well contradict this. She
lifted her head more defiantly than ever.</p>

<p>“My mother can’t see you,” she repeated. “Anything
you want to say to her can be said to me.”</p>

<p>Sir Frank admired her courage. He tried to
soften her.</p>

<p>“My dear Miss Neobard, I wish you would let
me speak to you as a friend. You can’t think I have
come here as an enemy. If I had I should have
brought Dr. Cassilis with me. Or rather I should
have sent him instead of coming myself.”</p>

<p>This shot told as he had expected. It was evident
that Sarah cherished a strong resentment
against me. It was a new light to her that my chief
might take a different view of the case. For the
first time she looked at him as if she thought it possible
that he might be sincere.</p>

<p>“Dr. Cassilis has practically accused me of murder,”
she said.</p>

<p>“Dr. Cassilis is a young man without much
experience. He has let himself become interested
in the young lady you seemed to suspect. He
spoke in her defence; I don’t believe that he really
thinks you had anything to do with Dr. Weathered’s
death. He went too far, of course, and I have
told him so. In fact, I have now taken him off
the case.”</p>

<p>The defiance began to die out of Miss Neobard’s
eyes. They were fine eyes and she knew how
to use them with effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>“Does that mean that I am not under suspicion
any longer?” she inquired in a more gracious voice.</p>

<p>“You never have been under suspicion as far as
I am concerned,” the doctor answered a little
evasively. “I feel sure you are a truthful woman,
and whatever you choose to tell me in confidence I
shall believe.”</p>

<p>Sarah was fairly conquered. Her voice broke
down as she replied.</p>

<p>“I am a wicked girl, Sir Frank. I did have
thoughts at one time that he ought to die. But
I never went farther than that. I swear to you on
my oath that I have no more idea how he was murdered,
or who murdered him, than you have—I
mean, I have no idea at all.”</p>

<p>The consultant thanked her with a grave bow.
“The evidence I have obtained so far points to suicide,”
he said quietly. “But I only tell you that in
confidence, to relieve your mind. Dr. Weathered
carried poison about with him.”</p>

<p>The step-daughter looked even more relieved
than Tarleton had expected, but a good deal surprised
as well.</p>

<p>“I knew that he took opium sometimes,” she
whispered back, “but I never guessed that he meant
to take his own life. I was afraid....” She
stopped short and shuddered.</p>

<p>The specialist took no notice of the suppressed
hint.</p>

<p>“You will see now, I hope, that I haven’t come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
here to try and get your mother to tell me anything
about you. As a matter of fact, my business with
her has nothing to do with the murder, or whatever
it was, except indirectly. I have come in the
interest of some of Dr. Weathered’s patients and I
think Mrs. Neobard may be able to help me to obtain
certain information on their behalf. I am sure you
won’t wish any evil he has done to go on after his
death.”</p>

<p>This way of putting it appealed to what was best
in Sarah Neobard. She looked puzzled but not disposed
to resist. She made another half-hearted
attempt to extract from the visitor what it was that
he had to ask her mother, but when she found him
firm in insisting that he must see Mrs. Neobard herself,
she gave way, and went to fetch her.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour, half an hour, passed.
There must have been a severe struggle going on in
the next room, although no sounds reached the
consultant through the wall. He had laid his hand
on the bell to summon a waiter and send a peremptory
message when the door at last opened and the
widow came in.</p>

<p>Tarleton felt convinced from the first moment
that she had guessed his business with her. Her
eyes were red and her naturally pale cheeks showed
a feverish flush. She was hardly able to walk and
her daughter supported her tenderly till she was in
a chair. Sarah herself was clearly ignorant of the
cause of her mother’s emotion. She glanced wonderingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
from her to Sir Frank and back again, and
seemed to be holding herself in readiness to defend
her parent or to back up Tarleton’s demand, according
to her judgment of what was the right course.</p>

<p>The examiner came to the point quickly.</p>

<p>“Miss Neobard has explained to you that this
is a confidential interview, I hope. Whatever you
say to me will be a secret between ourselves, unless
you authorize me to make use of it. It is for you
to decide whether your daughter is to remain in the
room, of course.”</p>

<p>The mother stretched out a hand and took hold
of one of her protector’s, who answered for her.
“I have promised my mother to remain.”</p>

<p>“Very good. I had better begin by reading you
this advertisement. It appeared in the paper yesterday.”</p>

<p>He read out the invitation from Messrs. James,
Halliday and James to the patients of the late Dr.
Weathered to apply for the return of their correspondence
and continued:</p>

<p>“The solicitor who put in this advertisement
refused to give the name of the client who is instructing
him. Will you tell me if it is you?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Neobard shook her head faintly without
speaking.</p>

<p>“Can you tell me if your late husband left a will,
and who is his executor?”</p>

<p>“I can answer that question,” Sarah put in.
“My mother is sole executor and he has left everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
to her. She wanted to renounce execution;
but the lawyer told her that it would be no use, as
the law would make her administrator. She is not
going to take a farthing of his money, if there
is any.”</p>

<p>“Quite so; then Mrs. Neobard is the only person
who is lawfully entitled to deal with any papers
Dr. Weathered left behind him. Can you explain
to me how these letters came to be in the possession
of this solicitor, or the person for whom he is
acting?”</p>

<p>The flush had faded from the widow’s cheeks,
leaving her very pale.</p>

<p>“I can’t explain,” she said in a whisper.</p>

<p>“Does it matter?” her daughter asked. “As
long as these people get their letters back again, what
does it matter who they got them from?”</p>

<p>“They won’t get them; that is what matters,”
the physician said gravely. “There is a criminal
behind this advertisement. I must explain to you
and to Mrs. Neobard, if she doesn’t know already,
what these letters were about.”</p>

<p>Very deliberately and keeping his eyes fixed on
the agitated woman all the time, Tarleton outlined
the story of his discoveries. He was careful not to
mention names. He explained why the doctor’s
case-book had been taken from the safe, and why
that precaution had proved useless. The dead man’s
real hold over his victims had been through the letters
he had persuaded them to write to him; those letters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
had been signed with a cipher, and the object of
the advertisement was to make the writers disclose
their identity so that they might be blackmailed by
the holder of their secret confessions.</p>

<p>The widow’s distress became pitiable as the explanation
proceeded. There could be no doubt that
she was no party to the plot and hardly a doubt that
its revelation had come to her as a complete shock.
As for Sarah Neobard, her fine eyes fairly blazed
with indignation.</p>

<p>“I never knew that such things were possible,”
she exclaimed. “I don’t believe—I can’t believe—that
my step-father ever meant to use the letters in
such a way.”</p>

<p>At this point the consultant saw Mrs. Neobard
open her eyes and look at him wistfully, as if to ask
him to take no notice of her daughter’s tenderness
for the scoundrel who had passed to his account.</p>

<p>“Surely you can’t think,” the girl pursued, “that
my mother knew anything about this? Mother!”—she
turned to the shrinking woman—“do you
hear? You must do everything you can to help Sir
Frank Tarleton to stop this iniquity.”</p>

<p>Now Sir Frank knew perfectly well that it
could be stopped pretty easily by the simple step of
Mrs. Neobard’s solicitors taking proceedings in her
name for the recovery of the letters. The legal
property in them, of course was vested in the writers,
but until they claimed them the executrix was entitled
to their possession; and if the Chancery Lane<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
sharper refused to give them up or to disclose their
whereabouts he was pretty sure to be struck off the
Rolls and stood a good chance of being indicted for
conspiracy. All this the adviser of the Home Office
had known from the first, but he took care to keep
the knowledge up his sleeve. For him the question
of the letters was a secondary one and he was only
using it as a means of opening the widow’s lips.</p>

<p>Miss Neobard suddenly stopped pleading with
her mother to say to the specialist, “I think I can
guess who has those letters—Madame Bonnell!”</p>

<p>This was another thing about which Tarleton had
entertained no doubt since seeing the advertisement.
But he received the suggestion with every sign of
disbelief.</p>

<p>“Madame Bonnell is the last person to whom I
should think Dr. Weathered would have trusted
them,” he answered.</p>

<p>“She may have stolen them,” the girl persisted.
“Perhaps he kept them at the Club and she has
found them since his death.”</p>

<p>“He kept nothing whatever at the Club except
the disguise he wore at the Club dances. I have
had the premises searched carefully by the police, and
they have questioned the staff. The letters are not
there now, and there is no receptacle in which they
could have been stored.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Neobard had been listening anxiously to
this discussion. Now she spoke.</p>

<p>“Who else do you think can have them?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>“That is what I want you to tell me. And I
think you can.”</p>

<p>The widow shivered again. Her daughter looked
at her with a dawning comprehension that something
was wrong.</p>

<p>“Mother, you must tell if you know.”</p>

<p>“Your husband kept these letters in a concealed
cupboard of his dressing-room,” Tarleton told her.
“Your house has been searched for a secret hiding-place
and the cupboard has been found.” It was a
bold shot, but the widow’s face showed that it had hit
the mark. “That cupboard is empty now. The law
presumes that you opened it, as you were entitled and
bound to do, after his death, and that you took possession
of its contents as executrix. I am here to
ask you in the name of the law what you have done
with them.”</p>

<p>He watched Dr. Weathered’s relict very closely
while he was speaking. She seemed to be wrenched
by conflicting fears. At one moment her lips parted
as if to speak, at the next they closed again more
tightly than before.</p>

<p>“Tell him, mother!” pleaded the girl.</p>

<p>The mother turned to her despairingly.</p>

<p>“I can’t! I daren’t! Don’t ask me to,” she
cried hopelessly.</p>

<p>The representative of the law looked at his watch.</p>

<p>“If that is your last answer you must be prepared
to take the consequences, Mrs. Weathered.” He
pointed dramatically to a window of the room.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
“Look out of that window, Miss Neobard, and tell
your mother what you see.”</p>

<p>Sarah rushed to the window and gave a sharp
cry. “Mother, there is a gendarme watching the
hotel!” She looked reproachfully at the physician.
“And you told me you came here as a friend!”</p>

<p>“I am trying to act as one. Your mother has
only to tell me the truth and I will open the window
and send that man away.”</p>

<p>“Do you hear, mother? You won’t let me be
arrested?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Weathered—Tarleton had meant to remind
her that she was passing under a name not legally
hers—had merely shivered again when she heard
who was outside. Now she sprang out of her chair,
a different woman.</p>

<p>“You! Arrest you! What do you mean, Sarah?
What have you to do with it? The police have
come for me.”</p>

<p>Sarah was not less amazed and horrified than
her mother.</p>

<p>“Nonsense; they can’t touch you,” she exclaimed.
“You weren’t at the dance that night!”</p>

<p>“And you were? My girl, my poor girl, what
have you been doing?”</p>

<p>“Sir Frank Tarleton knows. I have told him
everything. I think he means to be friendly, but he
can’t save me unless you speak out. She can speak
safely, can’t she?” the daughter asked imploringly.
“My mother isn’t in any danger?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>It was a question difficult to answer either way.
Tarleton felt the eyes of both women searching his
face, each with the same anxiety, though each on the
other’s behalf.</p>

<p>“It is only right that I should let you know that
Mrs. Weathered may be in danger. The letters
which ought to be in her possession may contain the
clue to your step-father’s murder.”</p>

<p>And now the scene became painful indeed to witness,
as the mother and daughter stood facing each
other with the questions in their eyes that they were
too terrified to put. Both of them at some time had
loved the murdered man; both of them, perhaps, had
come to hate him. And now each had been shaken
by a sudden revelation of the other’s hidden side.
The mother had just caught an appalling glimpse into
her daughter’s unknown relations with her step-father;
the daughter had been staggered by the suggestion
that her mother might have been his mortal
enemy. And all the time, beneath these mutual
dreads and suspicions it might be, these unconscious
jealousies, there prevailed, stronger than any other
feeling, that blind, unselfish love between mother and
child which made both of them eager to thrust themselves
into danger in the other’s place.</p>

<p>The parts had been reversed. It was Sarah who
was now anxious to close her mother’s mouth and
Mrs. Weathered who showed herself determined to
speak. The skilful manipulator of human nature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
who had wrought up this dramatic situation knew
that he had only to wait for the <i>dénouement</i> at which
he had aimed.</p>

<p>He had not to wait long.</p>

<p>“If you have trusted Sir Frank Tarleton I can
do the same,” the elder woman said at last. “I have
more to tell him than he knows. He thinks that I
only found those letters in the cupboard after my
husband’s death. I have been reading every one of
them for more than a year.”</p>

<p>If the consultant had not quite expected to hear
this he had been expecting something more than he
thought it wise to indicate just then. He let no sign
of his thoughts appear outwardly. The two women,
exhausted by the tempest of emotion they had
passed through, sat down side by side; but they kept
their eyes averted from one another, and only raised
them from time to time to watch the effect of Mrs.
Weathered’s narrative on him.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t think that I am an inquisitive
woman, Sir Frank. I didn’t discover my husband’s
secrets by prying. I never knew the existence of the
cupboard or the letters till one of the women who
had been led into writing to him came to me.”</p>

<p>This was news to the doctor. He pricked up his
ears for the name.</p>

<p>“She was a Miss Sebright—Miss Julia Sebright.”</p>

<p>“Ah! She is dead.” Tarleton thought it sound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
policy to show that he was able to check the statements
made to him.</p>

<p>“Yes. She died soon afterwards, of a broken
heart, I think. She came to me in despair and appealed
to me as Dr. Weathered’s wife to protect her
from him.”</p>

<p>Sir Frank got up, walked to the window, opened
it and waved his hand. The gendarme outside saluted
respectfully and marched away.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br>

THE MEANS TO DO ILL DEEDS</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> pale, weak woman had suddenly been transformed
in Tarleton’s eyes into a heroine. He saw in
her someone greater than himself. He was the official,
salaried guardian of society, called upon to run
no risks that a brave man ought to fear. But this
forlorn woman, without a friend in whom she could
confide, without support from public opinion or from
the law, had taken into her trembling hands the task
of delivering her sister women from a wretch whom
neither opinion nor the law could reach.</p>

<p>Mrs. Neobard—she had surely earned her right
to be called that now—thanked the doctor for his
impulsive action with a look. But it was not a look
of triumph. She proceeded with her story in the
tone of a loser rather than a victor.</p>

<p>“Miss Sebright told me that she had felt a longing
to become a mother, which she had no hope of
satisfying because she suffered from a depravity, a
club foot. She had been told as a child that no man
would ever want to marry her, except for her money,
and the result had been to make her distrust every
man who came near her. It was a sad story and I’m
afraid it is true of other women. Their self-distrust
robs them of the happiness within their reach, if they
only knew it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>The speaker sighed as though contrasting their
fate with her own opposite mistake.</p>

<p>“She told me she had come to my husband to
have the longing driven out of her mind; instead
of which he had persuaded her to become the mother
of an illegitimate child, by a man whose name was
not told her. The child was never born, happily—or
unhappily; I daren’t say which. But she had written
letters that disclosed what she had done, and now the
doctor was holding them over her. He hadn’t gone
so far as to demand money, but he was compelling
her to come or write to him every week and charging
her high fees. She would rather have paid a lump
sum to end it. The persecution was driving her out
of her mind. The poor thing actually offered me
a thousand pounds.”</p>

<p>It was a sickening story. Hardened as he was
to the ways of criminals, Tarleton listened to it
with nausea.</p>

<p>“I promised to find the letters and return them
to her if I could. I had to go to work secretly. If
I had said anything to my husband it would have
put him on his guard, and he would have placed the
letters somewhere out of my reach. I spied on him
till I saw him one day through the keyhole going
to a cupboard in the wall of his dressing-room,—the
one you found.”</p>

<p>The consultant forbore to correct her by saying
that the discovery had been made by Inspector
Charles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>“Of course, it was locked and I had no key that
would open it. So I went to an ironmonger’s one
day when the doctor was away for the week-end, and
asked him to send a confidential man to open it. I
pretended that my husband had lost the key while he
was away on a holiday, and wanted something in the
cupboard to be sent to him. I don’t know if they
believed me, but they said nothing, and they made me
a new key.”</p>

<p>In the same quiet way she went on, seeming to
see nothing extraordinary in the patient contrivance
by which she had outwitted the schemer who most
probably looked down upon her as a simple piece of
domestic furniture.</p>

<p>In the cupboard she had found a mass of correspondence,
by no means all of it from women, but
in almost every case containing painful and sometimes
hideous revelations of depraved and distorted
natures. The horrified woman had been obliged to
leave a good deal unread. The letters from each
correspondent were neatly kept on a separate file,
marked with the number under which he or she
wrote. These numbers puzzled her at first, as they
puzzled Tarleton himself, but she had only to ask
Miss Sebright for the explanation. Several numbers
were missing from the series. Either the writers
must have redeemed their rash confessions, or else
they had gone abroad or died, and the papers had
become valueless.</p>

<p>The real difficulty before Mrs. Neobard had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
to keep her promise to Miss Sebright without the
doctor’s knowing that his cupboard had been opened.
Now she saw her way. If the poor victim defied him
and he went to look for her file and found it gone, he
would probably think he had destroyed it himself
by mistake.</p>

<p>“He wasn’t always sober when he came in at
night,” the unfortunate wife said in a tone that
breathed of her past sufferings. “I felt sure he
couldn’t suspect me or anyone of taking one set of
letters and leaving all the rest. Anyhow, I decided
to risk it. I took Miss Sebright’s letters and sent
them to her by registered post. She wrote thanking
me very gratefully, but telling me that she was dying
and asking me to go and see her. I went more than
once. It was the sight of her sinking into her grave
under my husband’s cruelty that nerved me to go on.”</p>

<p>“I should have returned all the other letters now,
without caring what happened, if I had known where
to send them. But I had no key to whom the numbers
stood for.”</p>

<p>“You would have found that if you had looked
in Dr. Weathered’s appointment-book,” Sir Frank
told her.</p>

<p>The widow opened her eyes.</p>

<p>“I never thought of that! I see you know how
to find out everything, Sir Frank. Stop me if I am
telling you anything you know already.”</p>

<p>The consultant waved his hand courteously for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
her to go on. Her story had held one surprise for him
already, and he foresaw that others were to come.</p>

<p>“I waited. I now went to the cupboard every
day when I knew I was safe from interruption, to
read any fresh letters that had arrived, in the hope
of finding something in them that would give me a
clue to the writer’s identity. At last I found one
in which the writer had put her address at the head
in the usual way. I suppose she did it in forgetfulness.”</p>

<p>Tarleton breathed softly while he waited for the
name he was pretty certain of hearing.</p>

<p>“The address was Carlyle Square, Chelsea. I
looked it up in the Directory and found she was a
Mrs. Baker. Have you heard of her before?” Mrs.
Neobard gave him an imploring look.</p>

<p>“I knew her brother, the late Captain Armstrong,”
the specialist said, without answering the
question directly. “Please tell me everything.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Neobard made an effort and went on.</p>

<p>“I was disappointed, in a sense, to find that her
letters weren’t worth returning to her. There was
nothing in them that anyone could make use of to
harm her, as far as I could see. She was simply a
very foolish woman with fads. She had come to
my husband out of mere curiosity, I should think,
and he had played on her weakness. He had pretended
that she was secretly longing to commit a
murder; and the silly woman believed him. She
seemed rather proud of it than otherwise. I suppose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
it gave her a feeling of self-importance to think of
herself as a possible Mrs. Maybrick. In one of her
letters she compared herself with Miladi in the
‘Three Musketeers.’”</p>

<p>It was so exactly in keeping with his own impression
of the queer little woman in Carlyle Square
that Tarleton gave a nod of satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Ah! I see you do know her. But I suppose
you won’t tell me how much you know?”</p>

<p>The physician was obliged to shake his head.
“You could not trust me yourself, ma’am, if I did.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you are right,” she admitted regretfully.
“Well, I went on reading this Mrs. Baker’s
letters on the chance of finding something serious in
them; and at last there was. He had prompted her
to think out plans for committing a murder, and she
was actually sending them to him.”</p>

<p>A gasp drew Tarleton’s attention to Sarah Neobard,
who had sat hitherto listening in silence. Now
she seemed roused to a sense of impending tragedy,
and gazed at her mother with dilated eyes.</p>

<p>The widow directed a swift glance at her, and
withdrew it instantly.</p>

<p>“You can understand my terrible position, Sir
Frank. My eyes had been opened to my husband’s
character. I don’t say that he had always been a bad
man, but he had become one by now. I had the proof
under my eyes that he was a criminal, and a danger
to society. And here he was discussing plots of murder
with a weak, silly woman who seemed to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
under his thumb. Judging from her letters she was
quite capable of committing a murder out of vanity,
just to give herself the feeling that she was an extraordinary
person.”</p>

<p>The consultant did not credit this. But he was
not there to defend Mrs. Baker, and he did not want
to interrupt.</p>

<p>“I felt that if she did commit a crime she would
be doing it as my husband’s instrument, as much as
if he had hypnotized her, and that I must find some
way to prevent it. Then, while I was wondering how
to interfere, a letter came in which she said she had
a bottle of poison in her possession, a poison unknown
to the medical profession, that her brother had
brought with him from Sumatra. But I expect you
know about that?”</p>

<p>“I know the poison you speak of, certainly. The
brother sold me a quantity of it. He professed it
was all he had brought to England.”</p>

<p>“He deceived you, then. In the next letter she
described exactly where she kept the poison, in a
chiffonier in her drawing-room within reach of the
first caller. She boasted that she kept it under lock
and key, but almost anyone could pick a lock like
that, as even I could see. Of course, I knew from
that moment that the poison was within my husband’s
reach, and I felt sure he meant to take it.
Why else should he have asked about it so particularly?
What did it matter to him where it was kept,
unless he wanted it himself?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>“I quite agree with you,” said the specialist, seeing
that he was expected to reply.</p>

<p>“Now you see where I stood. I knew that my
husband was capable of committing a murder, if he
had anything to gain by it, and now I knew that he
was actually scheming to obtain a poison that couldn’t
be detected. I don’t think Mrs. Baker had an idea
that her brother had parted with some to you. She
wrote as though her bottle held all there was. And
who was it that he was thinking of murdering? I
couldn’t see anyone but myself.”</p>

<p>“Mother!” The word burst from Sarah’s agonized
lips. If she had retained any lingering softness
for the dead man it must have expired in that cry.
Her mother did not turn her head.</p>

<p>“I had to defend myself. I couldn’t prevent him
from taking the poison in any other way that I
could think of. I went to Mrs. Baker’s house and
stole the bottle.”</p>

<p>“You were quite right,” the physician agreed
again.</p>

<p>“I had no difficulty. I took a bunch of all the
keys I could find in the house, keys of wardrobes and
drawers and boxes of different sizes, and went round
to the Square. I walked up and down till I had seen
a woman who looked like the mistress of the house
come out, and then I knocked, and asked to be allowed
to wait upstairs. I gave some common name.”
She put her hand to her forehead. “That’s strange!
I can’t remember the name. Well, almost the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
key I tried opened the chiffonier and there stood the
bottle just as she had described it I put it into my
pocket and came away.”</p>

<p>Whatever theory Sir Frank had formed as to the
case, it had certainly not included this incident. He
had thought it possible that after Weathered had
carried off the bottle his wife had found it and taken
it in turn from him. He had never conjectured that
the feeble-looking woman had been brave and cool
enough to checkmate her husband in advance like this.</p>

<p>“For the moment I felt safe,” Mrs. Neobard
went on steadily. “But how long could I expect to
be from such a husband as mine? He was a doctor,
and it was easy for him to obtain other poisons. He
would have had to do that in any case, I think, as it
turned out. Mrs. Baker quarrelled with him soon
after, because he had advised her to kill a favourite
cat. She refused to have anything more to do with
him, and as her letters were more damaging to him
than to her he had no hold on her. I soon found that
he had destroyed them.”</p>

<p>This was another new light for the consultant.
And it prepared him for what was to come next.</p>

<p>“It seemed to me that my only chance of escape
was to leave him. But what reason could I give to
the world for doing so? I had nothing to complain
of as far as his treatment of me was concerned. He
was always perfectly courteous. We were on
friendly terms outwardly. I couldn’t prove that he
had been unfaithful to me; I wasn’t even sure in my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
own mind that he had been, yet, although the letters
showed me that he was pursuing one of his victims.
What could I say? Was I to denounce him publicly
as a scoundrel, and produce the letters? I might have
ruined dozens of innocent men and women. And I
might fail. I might find that the world sided with
him instead of me. I knew him well enough to
know exactly what he would do. He would say that
I had spied on his professional work, that I had
pried into the secrets of his patients and that jealousy
had made me insane. And he would have found
plenty of people to believe him. A wife who betrays
her husband is not likely to be forgiven.</p>

<p>“If I left him I doubted if my own daughter
would have come with me.”</p>

<p>This was the first allusion the mother had made
to her daughter’s unhappy infatuation. And it was
the last one. Sarah had begun to cry quietly. Now
Mrs. Neobard put out her hand again and took
her child’s.</p>

<p>“You won’t expect me to give you <i>all</i> my reasons
for deciding that I must act as I did, Sir Frank.
Perhaps you will think I really was insane. I don’t
know—after reading some of those letters that I
found I sometimes feel it difficult to say who is sane
and who isn’t. I can only say I thought over everything
time after time, as quietly as I could, and I
always came to the same conclusion. I think what
stuck in my mind most of all was the death of poor
Miss Sebright. There was no doubt that he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
murdered her, as surely as if he had given her arsenic.
I thought he ought to die.”</p>

<p>She said it without an effort, as though it were
the most natural conclusion in the world.</p>

<p>“It looked like a providence to me that I had
the poison ready. It was his own doing, you see. He
had helped me to it through wanting it himself for
his own wicked ends. I had taken it in self-defence,
and there it was, ready to be used.”</p>

<p>The listener remembered Shakespeare’s lines,
though he refrained from quoting them:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds
makes ill deeds done.”</p>
</div>

<p>The master of human nature had anticipated the
excuse of many King Johns. And in this case the
excuse seemed genuine. In fact, the widow did not
speak as though she meant to excuse herself; she
seemed to be simply explaining the sequence of her
thoughts.</p>

<p>“Then I came to a new difficulty, that I had never
expected. I found I couldn’t do it.”</p>

<p>It sounded like confession. There was far more
of apology in the tone with which she said this than
there had been in her whole previous statement. For
the first time there was moisture in her eyes.</p>

<p>“I had believed in him once.... I had loved
him.”</p>

<p>She broke down and ceased for a few moments.
Tarleton watched her with real pity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>“I dare say you will find it difficult to understand
me, Sir Frank, but I think most wives would.
I hadn’t changed my mind. I was still quite firm in
believing that it was right to put an end to my husband,
but I had to find someone else to do it.”</p>

<p>The consultant nodded. It was all plain to him
now. His theory had not been very far wrong,
after all.</p>

<p>“I decided that I must try to discover one of
his victims, one of the men who had confessed their
secrets to him and were suffering in consequence, and
give the poison to him. I didn’t think of the appointment-book,
unfortunately. The only way that occurred
to me of getting in touch with the writers of
the letters was to go to the Domino Club.”</p>

<p>Tarleton felt astray again for the moment. There
were more complications in the case than he had even
yet grasped.</p>

<p>“I expect you know all about the Club. My
husband had started it as a means of getting money
out of his patients, but it caught on, and became quite
a fashionable resort. It brought him something like
£1,000 a year. Of course, his name didn’t appear,
but everyone knew he was to be met there regularly.
He never missed a dance. The nominal proprietor
of the Club was the woman who managed it for him,
Madame Bonnell.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I knew all that. And I know Madame
Bonnell.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Neobard’s face betrayed some apprehension.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>“Know her as a friend, do you mean?” she
ventured.</p>

<p>“I know her well enough to think she could be
a very dangerous one.”</p>

<p>“Ah, then you <i>do</i> know her. I wish I had!...
I went to her to buy a ticket of admission to the
Club, as I wasn’t a member. I didn’t mean to tell
her who I was, but she knew somehow.”</p>

<p>“Madame Bonnell knew a good deal.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I found that out, too, before I had done
with her. She was all politeness; she pretended to
think I was coming out of curiosity and treated it as
a sort of joke. She promised of her own accord not
to let Dr. Weathered know. Promised it playfully,
you understand, as if it were of no consequence
whether he did or not. What she really thought I
can’t tell, but she must have suspected something and
meant to get me in her power.</p>

<p>“She deceived me completely. I asked her some
questions about the people who came, especially the
patients. I wanted to find out which of them came
against their will, but I hoped she wouldn’t see what
I was driving at.”</p>

<p>A sheep might as well have tried to hoodwink a
wolf, was Tarleton’s inward comment, but he
thought he had interrupted enough.</p>

<p>“She answered all my questions so glibly and
seemed so anxious to oblige that I was led on further
and further. At last she said, ‘You can see I am
a friend, madam; why not trust me? I see you want<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
to know your husband’s enemies and I am willing to
help you. This Club is full of them. Every time
the doctor comes here I consider he takes his life in
his hands.’</p>

<p>“I tried to draw back, but it was too late. She
refused to let me go. She said, ‘I must choose between
you and your husband, madam. He is my
employer, he pays me well, and if anything happens
to him you may engage another manageress, and I
shall lose my daily bread. If it is your object to preserve
him from danger we can work together.’</p>

<p>“She must have guessed pretty well by this time
that I had a different object, because she hardly
waited for me to answer. Before I could make up
my mind what to say, she went on: ‘On the other
hand, I have no friendship for Dr. Weathered. Of
late I have sometimes wished that he were out of
the way. The Club would do better without him in
my opinion. He is unpopular. And always I am
afraid of some terrible <i>esclandre</i>—some frightful
scene or some exposure that would ruin the Club and
perhaps injure my character.’”</p>

<p>In spite of the gravity of the situation Sir Frank
Tarleton relished Madame’s regard for her character,
though he kept his enjoyment to himself.</p>

<p>“She meant me to feel that she was on my side,
I could see. It seemed to be a pure matter of business
with her. She was ready to help me to save
my husband or to kill him—it didn’t matter which,
provided it was made worth her while. At the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
time she let me see that I was in her power. ‘It comes
to this,’ she said at last, ‘that if you are not going to
trust me I can’t afford to trust you. You may have
come here to pump me, to find out if I deserve your
husband’s confidence. In that case I must report this
conversation to him for my own protection; I expect
you to see that, madam.’”</p>

<p>It was all so clever, as clever as the advertisement
about the letters, Tarleton reflected. He did not
wonder that Mrs. Neobard had been overmatched.</p>

<p>“In the end I had to give in to her. I saw no
way out, and it looked as if she would be perfectly
willing to help me on her own terms. I undertook
to transfer the whole property in the Domino Club
to her on my husband’s death, and she undertook to
find one of his victims who hated him enough to
kill him, if he could do it safely, and give him the
secret poison. No one was to know where she had
obtained it.</p>

<p>“I took the bottle to her the next day. The
moment it was in her hands she said to me, ‘I must
have more than this, madam. I must have the letters
you have found. They are your justification for
planning your husband’s death, and I must have
them to show in my defence if I get into trouble for
assisting you.’</p>

<p>“I had been weak enough to tell her nearly everything
I have told you, because I couldn’t bear to let
her think that I was a bad woman acting from evil
motives. Now I repented too late. As usual, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
had a perfect answer to everything I could say. ‘It
comes to this, madam, that you have given me the
means to commit a murder, and you have made these
letters your excuse. If you decline to produce them
I must doubt if they exist, and as an honest woman
I shall hand this bottle over to the police.’”</p>

<p>Tarleton got out of his chair. If he did not yet
know all he wanted to know, he knew all that this
poor woman could tell him.</p>

<p>“Thank you. If I have your permission to use
this information in my own way neither you nor
your daughter need fear anything more.”</p>

<p>The astonished woman stopped him on the way
to the door.</p>

<p>“But after Madame Bonnell had got the letters
she turned round and refused to go on with the plot.
How did my husband die?”</p>

<p>“I am going to ask her that.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br>

THE FINGER-PRINT</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Sir Frank Tarleton walked into the room
on his return from Paris the first thing he did was
to put his gold repeater to his ear and make it ring out
its musical notes. It was the sign of triumph.</p>

<p>He told me everything just as I have described
it. Then he transfixed me with a question.</p>

<p>“I expect you to be as candid with me as Mrs.
Neobard has been. Did you put this poison into
Wethered’s cup along with the opium?”</p>

<p>It was no more than I ought to have expected;
no more than I had deserved. But it gave me a
greater shock than I could have thought possible.</p>

<p>“Before God I am innocent of that!” I swore.</p>

<p>My chief received my oath without any indication
of belief or disbelief.</p>

<p>“I don’t blame you for anything else you did on
behalf of Lady Violet,” he said gravely. “Even if
you hadn’t been in love with her, as a man you could
do no less than you did to save her from such a
scoundrel. You were right to drug him and right
to destroy his case-book. But you had no right to
take his life.”</p>

<p>I looked him in the face. I was too proud to
repeat my denial.</p>

<p>“That has been my greatest anxiety in the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
business, Cassilis. I liked you; you knew it, and I
think you should have confided in me.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t my secret,” I pleaded.</p>

<p>“I suppose that was the reason: yes, I accept that.
It was a mistake, though, because you had no chance
of keeping the secret. That is partly why I think
it better for you to drop this kind of work and go
in for private practice. You lack the first essential
for a detective, my dear fellow; you can hold your
tongue, but you can’t hold your face.”</p>

<p>I’m afraid I couldn’t hold it then. It blushed in
spite of me.</p>

<p>“I am a light sleeper, Cassilis, as you ought to
know. The telephone bell woke me some minutes
before you came into the house that first night. You
moved as quietly as a mouse as soon as you heard it,
but you see I was listening before it rang the second
time and I had heard you come up to the front door
and open it.”</p>

<p>How silly all my precautions seemed now! My
chief rubbed it into me with a touch of good humour.</p>

<p>“I gave you a hint that you might as well make
a clean breast of it at once, but you didn’t take it.
When you came in to me with Charles’s message
your face showed me that you had something more
on your mind than having gone out without letting
me know. And you gave yourself away when you
told me that you had been taken to the Domino Club
by a Captain Smethwick. There is no such name in
the Army List.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>Blunder after blunder, he recounted them all.
The theft of the case-book had pointed to the thief
being a doctor. The omission of Violet’s name from
the list I had copied supplied the key to my motives,
and my attack on Sarah Neobard left no doubt that
I was in love with the girl she had denounced. My
kind-hearted chief had willingly lent himself to my
plans for meeting Violet at Tyberton, though he had
tried to let me see he was not quite blind. He had
followed the history of the Zenobia costume easily
enough. And Violet’s refusal to give up the name of
her champion had told him more than it had told
poor, dull-witted me.</p>

<p>“That is my best reason for advising you to
start in practice for yourself, my boy. Consider
what your prospects are with me. I am at the top
of the tree now and my salary is a bare £1,500 a year.
And if I make another £500 by my private work it’s
as much as I make. That’s not enough for an earl’s
daughter to look forward to. You will make double
as a fashionable doctor. You have the most valuable
gift of all for the medical profession. You are a
good listener. The people who will come to you, the
patients who really bring in money, don’t want to be
cured. They like to fancy they are ill and they want
to talk about themselves. Let ’em do it and charge
them for it. With my influence and Lord Ledbury’s
you won’t have long to wait.”</p>

<p>I could only shake my head sorrowfully. “You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
are very good, sir; you are kinder to me than I deserve.
But I have no right to think that Lady Violet
will ever marry me.”</p>

<p>Sir Frank gave me a queer look.</p>

<p>“Then I tell you this—if you don’t marry her,
<i>I will</i>.”</p>

<p>Before I could recover from the start given me
by this threat he was consulting his watch again.</p>

<p>“Charles ought to be here by this time. And I
think he is. I shall be glad if you will come with
us, Cassilis. We are going to the Domino Club.”</p>

<p>I followed him thankfully into the hall, to meet
Inspector Charles and a quietly dressed Frenchman
who was briefly introduced to me as Brigadier Samson.
I took the invitation to go with them as a token
that my chief had acquitted me in his own mind at
least. I was ignorant whether I ever had been under
suspicion in the Inspector’s, and I am so still.</p>

<p>We drove to the Club in the taxi that had brought
the two police officers. We found it looking much
more cheerful than on the last occasion. The new
proprietress had evidently determined to make it a
greater success than ever, in spite of the little cloud
that had fallen on it. There were signs of renovation
going on in the hall and new decorations had
been put up in the ball-room.</p>

<p>The door was opened to us by the waiter Gerard,
who looked as amiable as ever, but rather more subdued.
The respectful glance he gave to Captain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
Charles seemed to tell of some intelligence between
them. Gerard was closely followed by another man
whose salute showed me that he was one of the Inspector’s
staff, in charge of the premises.</p>

<p>When Gerard, who had left us in the ball-room,
returned to say that Madame Bonnell was ready to
receive us, the French detective retained his seat. The
other three of us were conducted into a smartly furnished
parlour in which we found Madame enthroned
in all the dignity of her new position. She had put
on mourning for her late employer, but it was the
sort of mourning a good modiste knows how to make
a softener of grief rather than a perpetuation of it.</p>

<p>Madame Bonnell showed no trace of nervousness
at our appearance. Like a good general, she had
gauged her enemy in advance, she had anticipated
his attack, and her plans of defence had been skilfully
laid out. She received us in the manner of a
courteous business woman who was only anxious to
do whatever was asked of her.</p>

<p>I was conscious that my chief’s keen eyes were
on the look-out for any sign of recognition between
Madame and me, as I came into the room. Fortunately
she scarcely noticed me, and I think her
indifference must have finally satisfied him that we
were strangers to each other.</p>

<p>He came straight to the point.</p>

<p>“We have called on you, Madame, in consequence
of the advertisement from Messrs. James,
Halliday &amp; James.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>She heard this with composure. “What advertisement
is that?”</p>

<p>Tarleton ignored the affectation of ignorance.</p>

<p>“It may save time to tell you that every person
known to have been in correspondence with Dr.
Weathered has been warned to take no notice of that
advertisement.” It was evidently news to her that
the names of the correspondents were known to the
police, and she looked less confident already. “Mr.
Stillman has been informed that Dr. Weathered’s
executrix is the sole person entitled to deal with the
letters, and he has now consented to allow a detective
officer to sit in his outer office and refer any persons
who may answer the advertisement to me. The same
officer is opening all letters addressed to the firm.”</p>

<p>By this time Madame Bonnell must have made
up her mind that she had little chance of making
anything out of the letters and that it was better
for her to sacrifice them if she could do so without
damage to herself.</p>

<p>“What has all this to do with me?” she asked
cautiously.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Weathered informs me that she placed the
letters in your possession and I am here to ask you
for them.”</p>

<p>Madame Bonnell did some hard thinking and did
it quickly, too.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Weathered is a madwoman. She is not
responsible for her actions, and her word is not to
be believed. I am surprised that you should expect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
me to take such a story seriously. If you believe
I have the letters, look for them.”</p>

<p>It was a gallant last stand. She must have known
that every inch of the premises had been searched
already.</p>

<p>Tarleton smiled at her. He was beginning to
warm to his work.</p>

<p>“If I am to take advantage of that permission,
Madame, I shall have to ask you to accompany me
to Newgate Street, where there is a female searcher.
You probably carry the letters about with you.”</p>

<p>A sudden spark, a very ugly and dangerous
spark, was kindled in the woman’s eyes at the mention
of a female searcher. It went out again instantly.
Madame folded her arms.</p>

<p>“If you believe what you say, it makes no difference.
You say that Mrs. Weathered gave me those
letters. Why isn’t she here to ask for them back?
I have a right to keep them till she does.”</p>

<p>This was true, unfortunately. But Madame had
just been betrayed into revealing her weak point,
about which the representative of the Home Office
had been pretty confident before. He now turned to
Inspector Charles.</p>

<p>“I am afraid I must leave the matter to you,
Inspector.”</p>

<p>Captain Charles was quite ready.</p>

<p>“I must ask you to consider yourself my prisoner,
Madame. The charge is one of conspiring
with Arthur Stillman to obtain money from various<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
persons by threats. Whatever you may say will be
taken down and may be used in evidence against
you.”</p>

<p>She didn’t wait for the production of the official
note-book. Her hands were at the bosom of her
dress.</p>

<p>“That charge is false and you know it. It is you
who are using threats to obtain these letters, to which
you have no claim. You are breaking the law,
not I.”</p>

<p>She was right, that was the amazing part of it,
entirely right. But she handed over the letters. And
she contrived to look rather anxious.</p>

<p>“Let me tell you that I only consented to receive
those letters from Mrs. Weathered because I saw
she was a dangerous woman and I wanted to prevent
her from doing mischief. I meant to return
them to the writers the moment I knew who they
were. In my position I couldn’t afford to do otherwise.
I had to think of the reputation of the Club.”</p>

<p>Against this there was nothing to be said. It
was the second line of defence, of course. Tarleton
was not the man to waste time in assailing it.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Weathered tells me she gave you something
else beside those letters.”</p>

<p>Madame Bonnell needed no preparation to meet
this blow, which she had clearly been expecting. She
heaved a sigh, apparently one of relief.</p>

<p>“Ah, I am glad she has confessed that! It has
been a burden on my mind. I ought to have denounced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
her, I suppose, but I saw she was out of her
mind, and I was sorry for her. I thought it would
be enough if I took the poison from her and kept it
in a safe place.”</p>

<p>This was neater than even Tarleton had expected.
I saw positive respect in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Then you have the poison still, Madame, untouched?”</p>

<p>“But yes. I placed it among my little aids to the
toilet. You will find it in the cupboard you locked
up, you remember.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you will oblige me by fetching it. Inspector
Charles will unlock the door for you.”</p>

<p>The Inspector’s face fell as he rose to escort her.
Perhaps he thought that Sir Frank was being deceived.
They came back together, Charles carrying
the little bottle, which he silently handed to the
specialist.</p>

<p>Tarleton went through the form of wetting his
forefinger, taking up a few grains of the gray powder
and tasting it. His face told nothing.</p>

<p>“The powder now in this bottle is a harmless
mixture of charcoal and common salt. The poison
that killed Dr. Weathered was upasine.”</p>

<p>Madame Bonnell raised her hands in admirable
despair.</p>

<p>“<i>Mille tonnorres!</i> That wretched woman was
more mad than I thought. She mistook this stuff
for—what did you say, sir?”</p>

<p>The physician shook his head. “You do her an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
injustice. I have tested her story and I feel no doubt
that she placed the real poison in your hands. I
have seen the person from whom she took it and
from whose brother I obtained some of it myself.”</p>

<p>Again the first line of defence, a rather flimsy
one, had been broken through. The second line was
instantly unveiled.</p>

<p>“I have been robbed, then, that is what you
mean? Some wretch has stolen the drug and filled
up the bottle again to deceive me.”</p>

<p>“It looks like that, certainly.” Could I believe
that this was Tarleton speaking? His voice remained
perfectly steady as he went on. “Unfortunately,
one of the Club servants, named Gerard, has told the
police a different tale.”</p>

<p>All at once Madame Bonnell turned very white.
She began breathing in spasms.</p>

<p>“His story is that you threw out hints to him
that Dr. Weathered was in danger of being poisoned,
as you pretended, by enemies of his in the
Club. At a later time you bribed Gerard to say that
the doctor himself was afraid, and had given him
instructions to watch over his drinks. What really
happened was that your continued hints made Gerard
watchful, and on the fatal night he did see something
dropped in the doctor’s cup by a dancer whom
he described correctly. We know that it was a harmless
dose of opium, a drug to which Weathered was
immune, because he was taking it. Gerard reported
what he had seen to you and you thereupon told him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
that it was what you had feared but that you had an
antidote. You put this antidote, as you called it,
into a fresh cup of coffee, and made him take it to
the doctor. There is no doubt in my mind that he
died in consequence of drinking it.”</p>

<p>Madame Bonnell’s perfect composure was gone.
That angry spark had come back into her eyes to
remain there. She clenched her teeth, and her words
came through them like the click of castanets.</p>

<p>“Gerard is a bloody liar.”</p>

<p>The next instant she recollected herself. She
had still a third line of defence, a really good one
this time.</p>

<p>“Are you going to tell that story to the world?
Aha! I can tell stories, too. I shall have a fine tale
to tell about His Royal Highness the Crown Prince
of Slavonia; yes, yes. I shall tell how His Highness
came to dance with poisoners and prostitutes, and
people whose minds were fouler than any sink; and
saw a murder committed under his eyes by his partner
in the dance. Is it not so? And I shall recite
much from all those letters I have read. I have a
good memory, and I recite well.”</p>

<p>Tarleton acknowledged the strength of this
position.</p>

<p>“You are correct in thinking that the British authorities
have reasons for not taking proceedings
against you. Therefore, they propose to let you return
to your own country.”</p>

<p>“And give up my Club? Abandon my good fortune<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
at its height? I am not a very great fool, Sir
Frank Tarleton.”</p>

<p>My chief raised a finger. Captain Charles
sounded his whistle and Brigadier Samson stepped
through the door.</p>

<p>Slowly the woman recoiled on herself, seeming
actually to grow smaller in the act. The Brigadier
gave her a careless nod.</p>

<p>“You have dyed your hair, Leonie Marchand,
since I saw you last, but you haven’t changed your
finger-print, you know. And you are still wanted
for the murder in the Rue Lausanne.”</p>

<p>It was not a woman, it was a wild cat that sprang
at Sir Frank with tearing nails and spitting teeth.
I was just too late, but the French detective who
knew the nature of the animal, was just in time; and
he wasn’t hampered by any false sentiment. His
methods were not particularly pleasant to watch, but
they were effective. I think Charles rather envied
him.</p>

<p>The methods of the French criminal courts also
seem to be effective. At all events when I read the
newspaper report of the trial at which Leonie Marchand
was sentenced to imprisonment for life, it
contained no hint of any scandal about any royal
personage.</p>

<p>Sir Frank Tarleton was none the worse for the
little shock he had experienced, and for which he
rather blamed himself afterwards. He ought not to
have waited to see the arrest, he admitted to me, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
he couldn’t resist the temptation to see the real
woman come out. He hadn’t liked the sight.</p>

<p>“It lay between Madame and you from the first,
as far as I could see,” he explained to me, as we were
walking away together down Tarifa Road. “I
never believed the waiter’s story for a moment. The
idea that a man who knew his life to be in danger
would go on coming to the Club and trust to a foreign
waiter to prevent him from being poisoned, was
ridiculous in my eyes. It was clear that the story
had been put into his mouth by someone; and when
Madame told a similar story, about Weathered having
asked her to pour out his drinks herself, it was
easy to see who was the inventor. It was a case
of cleverness over-reaching itself. The theory that
Weathered had been poisoned by one of his patients
whom he was blackmailing was quite plausible in
itself; as we know, it was very nearly being the true
theory. If she had left it there and confined herself
to saying what she said to Mrs. Weathered, that she
knew he had enemies in the Club who would be glad
of his death, I might not have suspected her. But
when she took such pains to represent the whole place
as a nest of assassins with herself and Gerard as
guardian angels watching over the threatened man,
I began to smell a rat.</p>

<p>“I had no suspicion of Mrs. Weathered; I don’t
see how I could have had at that stage. Madame Bonnell’s
motives were just what would make a woman
of her stamp commit a crime. Sarah Neobard put it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
in a nutshell when she said she was a woman who
would do anything for money. The Domino Club
was doing well, and Weathered wasn’t necessary to
it any longer. In fact, he was beginning to be in the
way. She spoke the truth, probably, in saying that
she lived in fear of a scene of some kind. At the
same time, I doubt if she would ever have ventured
to poison him herself if the means hadn’t been put
into her hands. Here is the real murderer.”</p>

<p>He took out the little bottle, which he had brought
away with him. It was square-shaped and made of
ground glass, the sort of bottle in which smelling
salts are sold.</p>

<p>“I look on this case throughout as one of murder
by suggestion. Armstrong did very wrong to
leave this bottle in his sister’s possession. The very
precautions she took to keep it safely, as she thought,
show that her mind was exercised by it. I shouldn’t
wonder at all if Weathered, who was a clever man
in his way, actually did detect some latent fancies
in the little woman’s head as to how it might be
used, and worked on them till he convinced her that
they were serious. Then no sooner does he hear of
the existence of the bottle than it fascinates him. An
unknown drug, one whose effects will defy analysis—what
a prize for a man who is fast sinking into a
hardened criminal! Remember that if Armstrong
had not happened to bring a sample of his find to
me you might now be under sentence for the murder.”</p>

<p>I shook as I recognized the truth of what he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
said. Even Tarleton’s skill might have failed to
demonstrate the presence of a strange drug unknown
to the whole medical world.</p>

<p>“This accursed bottle next has the same effect
on Mrs. Weathered. She is a good woman and she
has been a faithful wife and a forgiving one. I
believe every word of her story. I fully believe that
she took the bottle with no intention to do anything
but destroy it and its contents. But no sooner is it in
her keeping than she succumbs to its temptation.
She is fascinated by the idea of the invisible death
it can deal. All kinds of motives and excuses spring
up in her mind like spectres conjured up by a magician.
So she becomes a murderess in intention, a
murderess by proxy, one may say.</p>

<p>“Even Madame Bonnell, I think it most likely,
had no idea of killing Weathered before this bottle
came into her hands. She had committed one murder
already and she seems to have had a narrow
escape that time. She was a prudent woman, too,
a woman to weigh risks carefully before taking them.
I think it quite probable that her only idea at first
was to use this bottle to extort money from Mrs.
Weathered. But very quickly she was in its power.
Then it was that she began weaving the romance of
Weathered’s revengeful patients, a picture only too
well founded on fact. She may have hoped to find
an enemy of Weathered’s to do the job for her;
however, you saved her the trouble. She saw her
chance, and that night she had a double security.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
From first to last it is evident that she trusted to the
Crown Prince’s name to pull her through everything,
and in a way it did.”</p>

<p>“What made you think she had committed a
crime in France, sir?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t. It was a mere shot in the dark. I
asked Charles to get her finger-print without her
knowing, and I took it over to Paris on the bare
chance that she might be known to the French police.
It is fortunate that she was.”</p>

<p>We were in Eaton Square by this time, after coming
along the King’s Road. My chief seemed to
know where he was going, but he did not tell me till
we had gone round the back of the Palace and come
out in Piccadilly. When we crossed the road my
heart began to beat quicker.</p>

<p>The dear old man had made up his mind to pull
me through, and I suspect he did it as much for
Violet’s sake as mine. He must have seen that there
was some obstacle between us, but he never asked
what it was. He only gave me one hint before we
reached the house.</p>

<p>“No man ever won a woman yet by making the
worst of himself, Cassilis. If you haven’t anything
else to be proud of, be proud of being loved and
show it.”</p>

<p>The Earl, whom we found at home, was more
than half prepared to listen to us. He had changed
for the better, too, since he had taken Sir Frank’s
advice. He showed that he felt he owed a debt to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
him and another to his daughter, and was not unwilling
to discharge both. It was my advocate who
did most of the talking. He surprised and delighted
me by telling my prospective father-in-law that I
needn’t throw up my post under him just yet. “Not
till he is on his feet comfortably,” he put it.</p>

<p>In the end the Earl said, “Well, I will see what
my daughter has to say, Dr. Cassilis.” And he rang
the bell.</p>

<p>When Violet came in she saw why she had been
sent for, before her father spoke. She had her
answer ready when he put the question. “This
young gentleman has come here to ask me for your
hand, Violet. What am I to say to him?”</p>

<p>“He hasn’t asked me yet,” she whispered.</p>

<p>My dear chief sprang to his feet. “I think we
had better leave these young people together, my
lord.”</p>

<p>We are together still.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg&#8482;.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg&#8482; works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.&#8221;
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works.
    </div>
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>

<div style='display:block; font-size:1.1em; margin:1em 0; font-weight:bold'>
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
